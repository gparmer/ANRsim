# Analysis of Deck Design via Kit

Many identities provide a fairly general value proposition:  Andy provides a strong start, a thinned deck, and increased consistency; Kate provides discounts on installing things you want to install; and Maxx provides increased draw power, and increased utility for archives tutors.  I will call these "generalists".  Other runner identities provide an antagonistic focus on certain types of corporations.  Among these: Wizzard who loves asset-based decks; Edward Kim who hates on operation-focused corporations; and, to some degree, Silhouette who hates on corporations that rely heavily on hidden information.  I will call these "antagonists".  Another class of runner identities, however, provide very specialized benefits that aren't generally-focused, and don't hate on specific corporate archetypes.  They instead specialize their own focus on a specific aspect of the game.  These include the likes of Gabe with a narrow-sighted focus on HQ attack, Ken with an emphasis on fielding run events, Noise with his affection for viruses, and our favorite cyborg, Kit who wants to spread the code-gate gospel to all of her ice-friends.  I will call these runners "specialists".   

Generalist runners do benefit from decks that are constructed specifically to take advantage of their benefits.  For example, Kate yields a higher rate of return if the focus is on cheap hardware and programs, and Maxx begs for cards that interact with the heap.  Antagonists generally don't benefit as much from deck specialization but for ensuring that their hate will be felt (e.g. making sure Silhouette can get into HQ).  However, specialist runners **demand** that decks be constructed for them.  Slotting a specialist id into a general deck defeats the entire point of the id and diminishes its value.

I'm the type of person who likes 60% deck building, and 40% playing.  So I appreciate the challenge of leveraging the benefits provided by a specialist identity, and finding the perfect economic package, breakers, and tricks to support it.  This is generally the reason I play Kit religiously.  The fact that she only provides 10 influence, though a significant weakness, only feeds into the addiction to challenges in deckbuilding.  After a year of playing the sole runner cyborg with a love for ice, and seeing how data-packs have changed and honed her focus, I think that a design study is useful.  However, before we get to a proper analysis of the card pool that supports the curious cyborg, we have to analyze in depth a single card: the identify itself.

Multiple articles have been written about Kit.  I don't plan to rehash their arguments, and I generally agree with them.  [Feliks](http://stimhack.com/peddling-peddler-all-things-kit/) provides a great overview of Kit with respect to the Dec 2014 card pool with many points being made relative to the meta of the time.  [Sutcliffe](http://thesatelliteuplink.blogspot.com/2013/11/rielle-kit-peddler-cracking-code.html) presents an overview of the Yogosaurus Kit and a light version of ice destruction.  Thought his article is somewhat dated, the analysis of Kit's strengths and weaknesses is still quite relevant.  These articles are great.  You should read them.  However, one of their main focuses is an analysis of Kit with respect to the card pools of the time.  Both articles *touch* on topics that are more general, but don't focus on them.  This article provides a slightly different focus by analysing Kit from a fundamental standpoint somewhat removed from the card-pool.  Though this means that the article is more vague, and includes fewer concrete take-aways, I believe it is useful none-the-less.  Kit is part of a "big box", so she will *not* get rotated out; she's with us for the long term, so it is useful to forsee her areas of utility for years (and cycles) to come.

## The Many Faces of Kit

The analysis of a single card in a vacuum (an arguably useless exercise) is a deductive process.  It is concerned with answering the question, "what implications can be drawn about the strengths and weaknesses of the identity"?  Lets go through a list of these implications:

1. **Early aggression.** This is the most obvious, and most touted benefit of Kit.  You only need a single breaker to be able to break the first ice (of whatever type) per turn!  Instant aggression.  *Implications:* A Kit player wants to find their code-gate breaker of choice, and to be running with it ASAP.

 1a. **Avoid gear-checks.** Ice types normally provides the main impetus for gear-checks.  For Kit, that isn't necessarily so (until ice towers grow).  Thus, she hates *other* forms of gear-checks (for example, Wraparound).

2. **One run per turn.** The second most obvious implication of Kit's ability is that only the first ice encountered turns into a code-gate, thus only the first run per turn benefits.  *Implication.*  Going all-in on the one-run-per-turn maximises Kit's utility.  However, if you want to not auto-lose against RP, you have to have a backup plan.

3. **Preference for shallow servers.** The percent of ice impacted by her ability on any given run is inversely proportional to the height of the server (i.e. the number of ice).  A three-deep server with no rezzed ice does not benefit as much from Kit's ability as a server with a single ice.  In fact, deep servers are the main mechanism to force Kit to gear-check, which removes much of her utility by moving her from "early decoder aggression" into a "typical shaper" phase -- but without any additional identity benefits.

 3a. **Preference for rezzed ice closer to the server.**  When servers do have multiple layers of ice, there's a strong preference for ice to be rezzed on the inside.  During a run, if the outside ice is rezzed, Kit's ability enables you to handle it, and if the inside (rezzed) ice is nasty, you can jack out.  If the outside ice isn't rezzed, then Kit's ability lets you handle the nasty ice as well.  Win-win:  either you get in, or you force the corp to spend credits on ice. *Implications:* Early aggression serves a double purpose -- get accesses, and rez ice!  This pressure should be spread across servers to rez as much shallow ice early as possible (so Cyber-Cypher does not help us here).

4. **Importance of ice placement.** This is another trivial implication: code-gates on as the outer-most ice essentially deactivate Kit's ability.  However, this is a little bit of an overstatement: ensuring an outer-most code-gate is not always trivial, often requiring a) the placement of ice to be delayed, thus opening earlier windows, b) consideration when installing subsequent ice on the server as the code-gate is not the first encountered anymore, and c) decreased tax as Kit's decoders can often break relatively efficiently.

 4a. **Avoid outer-most code-gates.** Regardless, Kit does _not_ want the outer-most ice to be a code-gate, to maximize the utility of her ability.  Foremost, she does not want the outer ice to be a trivial (cheap to rez) code-gate such as Popup Window as this a) removes economic pressure (see 5.), and b) is often no more efficient to break with the decoder of choice than with no breaker (Yog and stealth being the exceptions).

5. **Early economic pressure.** A side effect of being able to apply early aggression is that you're also applying quite a bit of early economic pressure by forcing ice rezzes.  Though it is debatable if this pressure is much greater than a normal runner without breakers, Kit enables a) sustained pressure as she doesn't suffer the impact of the rezzed early ice (e.g. cortex lock), and b) her pressure can persist up to two levels of ice when the inside ice is rezzed (see above).  This will impact some corps more than others, depending on how expensive their ice is.  *Implication:* As above, uniform pressure across *all* servers is useful here, damaging the prospects of Cyber-Cypher.

6. **Mid-to-late game economic efficiency.** It is natural for Kit to use a decoder that is efficient.  You're using it at least once per run (often once per turn), so it better be cheap to use.  Once the ice towers are built, and Kit has to find her other breakers (at least the Killer), her ability transforms into a complex form of an economy engine.  This reinforces the importance of ice placement for the corp.  Expensive ice on the outside of servers maximises the economic efficiency afforded by the decoder.

7. **Centrality of code-gate breaker.** You can tell a lot about a Kit deck from the chosen decoder.  The most telling is a Cyber-Cypher suite.  Such a package means less economic pressure early on, but more intense, focused aggression.  This is the equivalent of Gabe: get in with early high-impact runs, or die trying.  Run events for multi-access and disruption are the king.  A breaker package centering around Gordian Blade cedes quite a bit of early pressure, in comparison, but also doesn't focus entirely on turning Kit's ability into later economic efficiency.  Refractor is based on a multi-card combo, and often cedes even more early game pressure for significant late-game econcomic efficiency.  The goal of Kit's decks are entirely intertwined with the chosen decoder.

 7a. **Preference for code-gates.** Reinforcing 6., as the decoder is so central, the runner almost always prefers to see code-gates.  This is the motivation behind Kit destruction decks, and, ironically, the reason Spooned decks aren't that great.  A good corp will have a code-gate on the outside anyway, so stripping that of with Spooned doesn't do much if our decoder is efficient.
 
8. **Focused application of influence.** Ten influence seems to be one of the biggest forum topics about Kit.  "They should have made it 12" calls ring out in despiration.  Regardless, the cardboard is printed with 10, so deck design has to accommodate that.  With 10, there is hardly any space for influence to be applied arbitrarily, and it must support the main goals of the overall deck.

## Kit Economies

This is one of the least interesting aspects of a Kit deck, mainly because there aren't many options.  They are:

1. *Magnum Opus focused.*  A single card to provide all of your economic needs sounds wonderful.  And it is, in the right deck.  The downsides are the constrained memory, the tempo hit early on to get the Opus out, the card slots for the tutors to make that consistent, and the difficulty of balancing both card draw and clicking your Opus.  To approach this challenge, cards that aid in draw are required (Diesel is almost mandatory, and Symmetric Visage or Quality Time are great in different decks).
2. *Resource focused.*  Kati is the staple of many decks, and this would be no different.  Pair that with Daily Casts, Symmetric Visage, and enough events to keep afloat, and you have a decent economic core.
3. *Event focused.*  Kit is not Kate when it comes to leveraging Prepaid Voice Pads, and 3 lucky finds eat up too much of Kit's influence.  Day Jobs are a decent replacement, but are often difficult to use.  Regardless, this *can* work in the right deck, and might even make decent use of Comet (though doubtfully along-side Prepaids).

## Kit Prototypes

Given the different implications, what are the main focuses of Kit?  If we chose a few different styles that Kit wants to play, what are they?

#### Aggression

This prototype feeds off of Kit's ability to get in early to as quickly as possible turn clicks into scored agendas.

The core of the deck is

- Cyber-Cypher, ZU.13, or in some cases Gordian Blade.  The emphasis here is that it is cheap enough to get out early.
- Maker's Eye
- Legwork
- R&D Interface
- Modded

This can be augmented with a number of pressure and disuption cards like Utopia Shard and Imp.  Given the emphasis on impactful runs, and minimal rig, 

#### Econ Denial

This prototype attempts to force early ice rezzes to keep the corp poor, while constantly building.  Early random accesses will yield some points, but an economic lead later on will finish it later.

#### Econ Efficiency

This prototype focuses on a steady build up of board state over time, culminating in cheap, impactful runs.  It relies on Kit's ability to prevent the corp from running away with the game early on.

#### Destruction Kit

If Kit doesn't like deep servers, why not kill the ice till they aren't deep anymore!  This is a long-studied prototype that hasn't seen much play recently.
