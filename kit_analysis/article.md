# Analysis of Deck Design via Kit

Many identities provide a fairly general value proposition:  Andy provides a strong start, a thinned deck, and increased consistency; Kate provides discounts on installing things you want to install; and Maxx provides increased draw power, and increased utility for archives tutors.  I will call these "generalists".  Other runner identities provide an antagonistic focus on certain types of corporations.  Among these: Wizzard who loves asset-based decks; Edward Kim who hates on operation-focused corporations; and, to some degree, Silhouette who hates on corporations that rely heavily on hidden information.  I will call these "antagonists".  Another class of runner identities, however, provide very specialized benefits that aren't generally-focused, and don't hate on specific corporate archetypes.  They instead specialize their own focus on a specific aspect of the game.  These include the likes of Gabe with a narrow-sighted focus on HQ attack, Ken with an emphasis on fielding run events, Noise with his affection for viruses, and our favorite cyborg, Kit who wants to spread the code-gate gospel to all of her ice-friends.  I will call these runners "specialists".   

Generalist runners do benefit from decks that are constructed specifically to take advantage of their benefits.  For example, Kate yields a higher rate of return if the focus is on cheap hardware and programs, and Maxx begs for cards that interact with the heap.  Antagonists generally don't benefit as much from deck specialization but for ensuring that their hate will be felt (e.g. making sure Silhouette can get into HQ).  However, specialist runners **demand** that decks be constructed for them.  Slotting a specialist id into a general deck defeats the entire point of the id and diminishes its value.

I'm the type of person who likes 60% deck building, and 40% playing.  So I appreciate the challenge of leveraging the benefits provided by a specialist identity, and finding the perfect economic package, breakers, and tricks to support it.  This is generally the reason I play Kit religiously.  The fact that she only provides 10 influence, though a significant weakness, only feeds into the addiction to challenges in deckbuilding.  After a year of playing the sole runner cyborg with a love for ice, and seeing how data-packs have changed and honed her focus, I think that a design study is useful.  However, before we get to a proper analysis of the card pool that supports the curious cyborg, we have to analyze in depth a single card: the identify itself.

Multiple articles have been written about Kit.  I don't plan to rehash their arguments, and I generally agree with them.  [Feliks](http://stimhack.com/peddling-peddler-all-things-kit/) provides a great overview of Kit with respect to the Dec 2014 card pool with many points being made relative to the meta of the time.  [Sutcliffe](http://thesatelliteuplink.blogspot.com/2013/11/rielle-kit-peddler-cracking-code.html) presents an overview of the Yogosaurus Kit and a light version of ice destruction.  Thought his article is somewhat dated, the analysis of Kit's strengths and weaknesses is still quite relevant.  These articles are great.  You should read them.  However, one of their main focuses is an analysis of Kit with respect to the card pools of the time.  Both articles *touch* on topics that are more general, but don't focus on them.  This article provides a slightly different focus by analysing Kit from a fundamental standpoint somewhat removed from the card-pool.  Though this means that the article is more vague, and includes fewer concrete take-aways, I believe it is useful none-the-less.  Kit is part of a "big box", so she will *not* get rotated out; she's with us for the long term, so it is useful to forsee her areas of utility for years (and cycles) to come.

## The many faces of Kit

The analysis of a single card in a vacuum (an arguably useless exercise) is a deductive process.  It is concerned with answering the question, "what implications can be drawn about the strengths and weaknesses of the identity"?  Lets go through a list of these implications:

1. **Early aggression.** 

2. **Early economic pressure.** 

3. **One run per turn.**

4. **Preference for shallow servers.**

 **Preference for rezzed ice closer to the server.**

5. **Importance of ice placement.**

 **Avoid outer-most code-gates.** 

6. **Mid-to-later game economic efficiency.**

7. **Centrality of code-gate breaker.**

 **Preference for code-gates.**
