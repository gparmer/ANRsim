# A First-Principles Approach to Deck Design

ANR is actually multiple games cramed into one.  The obvious game is a face-off between two individuals with two decks.  The less obvious one is the solitary game you play when you construct the decks that will go to battle.   If you like ANR mainly or solely for the competition -- for the actual act of playing -- then I see no reason not to netdeck (i.e. look at the winning lists on stimhack.com, and play them).  I have the greatest respect for players that can play at the highest levels.   For the rest of us, deckbuilding is a fun and important part of ANR.  However, sitting down to deck build can often, especially for beginners, be a tedious and confusing ordeal.  This article will be the first in a series that explores one methodology for deck building that will hopefully guide those who aren't quite proficient, and maybe provide another perspective for those who are.

This article is *not* intending to tell you "how its done", and is not trying to be the final word on the matter.  The ANR community is so great because a huge number of people have a significant impact on how we think about and discuss the game.  This is my perspective on how I enjoy building decks.  It is based around 

1. identifying all deductive inferences you can draw about the areas of both strength and weakness of a specific card (or small set of related cards), 
2. mentally create sets of scenarios which best utilize the card, for example, rush, resource denail, etc...,
3. identify sets of cards that best contribute to these scenarios, 
4. identify the weaknesses of these scenarios, 
5. identify sets of cards that mitigate the weaknesses of those scenarios, 
6. choose your decks based on cards from those sets that optimize around the specific card's strongest scenarios.

Last, this procedure must be repeated for each card (or set of related cards) in the set.  When optimizing for a specific scenario (i.e. early rush, resource denial, etc...), each card should not only promote this or mitigate its shortcomings, but should also work well with other cards in the deck.  Thus this step of re-analysing each card is important.  One could accurately say that we are simply seeking synnergy when conducting this entire exercise.  However, this procedure forces us to go beyond surface-level synnergies between cards, and see the sets of cards that complement strategies, for example, Stimhack being quite strong in Magnum Opus-based economies.

This technique for deck construction is meta-agnostic and is likely quite weak at finding the most competitive decks.  That said, it certainly makes understanding and analysing the tournament-winning decks rather trivial, thus might help you tweak them to your liking.  The technique's target audience is those who enjoy optimizing around ideas, and making decks that are the best they can be.

## Analysis of Deck Design via Kit

Many identities provide a fairly general value proposition:  Andy provides a strong start, a thinned deck, and increased consistency; Kate provides discounts on installing things you want to install; and Maxx provides increased draw power, and increased utility for archives tutors.  I will call these "generalists".  Other runner identities provide an antagonistic focus on certain types of corporations.  Among these: Wizzard who loves asset-based decks; Edward Kim who hates on operation-focused corporations; and, to some degree, Silhouette who hates on corporations that rely heavily on hidden information.  I will call these "antagonists".  Another class of runner identities, however, provide very specialized benefits that aren't generally-focused, and don't hate on specific corporate archetypes.  They instead specialize their own focus on a specific aspect of the game.  These include the likes of Gabe with a narrow-sighted focus on HQ attack, Ken with an emphasis on fielding run events, Noise with his affection for viruses, and our favorite cyborg, Kit who wants to spread the code-gate gospel to all of her ice-friends.  I will call these runners "specialists".   

Generalist runners do benefit from decks that are constructed specifically to take advantage of their benefits.  For example, Kate yields a higher rate of return if the focus is on cheap hardware and programs, and Maxx begs for cards that interact with the heap.  Antagonists generally don't benefit as much from deck specialization but for ensuring that their hate will be felt (e.g. making sure Silhouette can get into HQ).  However, specialist runners **demand** that decks be constructed for them.  Slotting a specialist id into a general deck defeats the entire point of the id and diminishes its value.

I'm the type of person who likes 60% deck building, and 40% playing.  So I appreciate the challenge of leveraging the benefits provided by a specialist identity, and finding the perfect economic package, breakers, and tricks to support it.  This is generally the reason I play Kit religiously.  The fact that she only provides 10 influence, though a significant weakness, only feeds into the addiction to challenges in deckbuilding.  After a year of playing the sole runner cyborg with a love for ice, and seeing how data-packs have changed and honed her focus, I think that a design study is useful.  However, before we get to a proper analysis of the card pool that supports the curious cyborg, we have to analyze in depth a single card: the identify itself.

Multiple articles have been written about Kit.  I don't plan to rehash their arguments, and I generally agree with them.  [Feliks](http://stimhack.com/peddling-peddler-all-things-kit/) provides a great overview of Kit with respect to the Dec 2014 card pool with many points being made relative to the meta of the time.  [Sutcliffe](http://thesatelliteuplink.blogspot.com/2013/11/rielle-kit-peddler-cracking-code.html) presents an overview of the Yogosaurus Kit and a light version of ice destruction.  Thought his article is somewhat dated, the analysis of Kit's strengths and weaknesses is still quite relevant.  These articles are great.  You should read them.  However, one of their main focuses is an analysis of Kit with respect to the card pools of the time.  Both articles *touch* on topics that are more general, but don't focus on them.  This article provides a slightly different focus by analysing Kit from a fundamental standpoint somewhat removed from the card-pool.  Though this means that the article is more vague, and includes fewer concrete take-aways, I believe it is useful none-the-less.  Kit is part of a "big box", so she will *not* get rotated out; she's with us for the long term, so it is useful to forsee her areas of utility for years (and cycles) to come.

## The Many Faces of Kit

The analysis of a single card in a vacuum (an arguably useless exercise) is a deductive process.  It is concerned with answering the question, "what implications can be drawn about the strengths and weaknesses of the identity"?  Lets go through a list of these implications:

1. **Early aggression.** This is the most obvious, and most touted benefit of Kit.  You only need a single breaker to be able to break the first ice (of whatever type) per turn!  Instant aggression.  *Implications:* A Kit player wants to find their code-gate breaker of choice, and to be running with it ASAP.

 1a. **Avoid gear-checks.** Ice types normally provides the main impetus for gear-checks.  For Kit, that isn't necessarily so (until ice towers grow).  Thus, she hates *other* forms of gear-checks (for example, Wraparound).

2. **One run per turn.** The second most obvious implication of Kit's ability is that only the first ice encountered turns into a code-gate, thus only the first run per turn benefits.  *Implication.*  Going all-in on the one-run-per-turn maximises Kit's utility.  However, if you want to not auto-lose against RP, you have to have a backup plan.

3. **Preference for shallow servers.** The percent of ice impacted by her ability on any given run is inversely proportional to the height of the server (i.e. the number of ice).  A three-deep server with no rezzed ice does not benefit as much from Kit's ability as a server with a single ice.  In fact, deep servers are the main mechanism to force Kit to gear-check, which removes much of her utility by moving her from "early decoder aggression" into a "typical shaper" phase -- but without any additional identity benefits.

 3a. **Preference for rezzed ice closer to the server.**  When servers do have multiple layers of ice, there's a strong preference for ice to be rezzed on the inside.  During a run, if the outside ice is rezzed, Kit's ability enables you to handle it, and if the inside (rezzed) ice is nasty, you can jack out.  If the outside ice isn't rezzed, then Kit's ability lets you handle the nasty ice as well.  Win-win:  either you get in, or you force the corp to spend credits on ice. *Implications:* Early aggression serves a double purpose -- get accesses, and rez ice!  This pressure should be spread across servers to rez as much shallow ice early as possible (so Cyber-Cypher does not help us here).

4. **Importance of ice placement.** This is another trivial implication: code-gates on as the outer-most ice essentially deactivate Kit's ability.  However, this is a little bit of an overstatement: ensuring an outer-most code-gate is not always trivial, often requiring a) the placement of ice to be delayed, thus opening earlier windows, b) consideration when installing subsequent ice on the server as the code-gate is not the first encountered anymore, and c) decreased tax as Kit's decoders can often break relatively efficiently.

 4a. **Avoid outer-most code-gates.** Regardless, Kit does _not_ want the outer-most ice to be a code-gate, to maximize the utility of her ability.  Foremost, she does not want the outer ice to be a trivial (cheap to rez) code-gate such as Popup Window as this a) removes economic pressure (see 5.), and b) is often no more efficient to break with the decoder of choice than with no breaker (Yog and stealth being the exceptions).

5. **Early economic pressure.** A side effect of being able to apply early aggression is that you're also applying quite a bit of early economic pressure by forcing ice rezzes.  Though it is debatable if this pressure is much greater than a normal runner without breakers, Kit enables a) sustained pressure as she doesn't suffer the impact of the rezzed early ice (e.g. cortex lock), and b) her pressure can persist up to two levels of ice when the inside ice is rezzed (see above).  This will impact some corps more than others, depending on how expensive their ice is.  *Implication:* As above, uniform pressure across *all* servers is useful here, damaging the prospects of Cyber-Cypher.

6. **Mid-to-late game economic efficiency.** It is natural for Kit to use a decoder that is efficient.  You're using it at least once per run (often once per turn), so it better be cheap to use.  Once the ice towers are built, and Kit has to find her other breakers (at least the Killer), her ability transforms into a complex form of an economy engine.  This reinforces the importance of ice placement for the corp.  Expensive ice on the outside of servers maximises the economic efficiency afforded by the decoder.

7. **Centrality of code-gate breaker.** You can tell a lot about a Kit deck from the chosen decoder.  The most telling is a Cyber-Cypher suite.  Such a package means less economic pressure early on, but more intense, focused aggression.  This is the equivalent of Gabe: get in with early high-impact runs, or die trying.  Run events for multi-access and disruption are the king.  A breaker package centering around Gordian Blade cedes quite a bit of early pressure, in comparison, but also doesn't focus entirely on turning Kit's ability into later economic efficiency.  Refractor is based on a multi-card combo, and often cedes even more early game pressure for significant late-game econcomic efficiency.  The goal of Kit's decks are entirely intertwined with the chosen decoder.

 7a. **Preference for code-gates.** Reinforcing 6., as the decoder is so central, the runner almost always prefers to see code-gates.  This is the motivation behind Kit destruction decks, and, ironically, the reason Spooned decks aren't that great.  A good corp will have a code-gate on the outside anyway, so stripping that of with Spooned doesn't do much if our decoder is efficient.
 
8. **Focused application of influence.** Ten influence seems to be one of the biggest forum topics about Kit.  "They should have made it 12" calls ring out in despiration.  Regardless, the cardboard is printed with 10, so deck design has to accommodate that.  With 10, there is hardly any space for influence to be applied arbitrarily, and it must support the main goals of the overall deck.

## Kit Prototypes

Given the list of deductions we've made from the identity's ability, we can create a number of abstractions, or deck prototypes that are suppored by the deductions.  In some sense, we're looking for the "natural conclusions" of the deductions.  These include (though likely aren't limited to):

- *Aggression* - Get in early, and turn clicks into agendas.  Fast.
- *Economy Denial* - Kit's ability pressures early game rezzes.  Constant runs turn these rezzes into singificant economic pressure.
- *Economic Efficiency* - If your code gate's efficient, you're essentially bypassing the costs of at least one ice per turn.
- *Ice Destruction* - We don't like layered ice, so pare down the layers!

Lets dive in to each.  

#### Aggression

This prototype feeds off of Kit's ability to get in early to turn clicks into scored agendas as quickly as possible.  This follows from the following deductions from Kit's card:

- **One decoder to rule them all (#1).** Once Kit has her decoder out, she avoids early gear checks (#1a).  Thus she can often get in past when other runners need to focus on digging for breakers.
- **Early economic pressure (#5).** The longer that early game lasts (i.e. when Kit can get in without additional significant gear-checks), the better for an aggro build.  When the corp is rezzing ice, it often keeps them poorer than they want, and prolongs Kit's accesses.  It should be noted that the longer this phase is maintained, the more agendas will pile up in HQ, increasing the chance of hitting them on access.
- **Preference for shallow servers (#3).** Shallow servers exist, if ever, early game.  So why not go petal to the metal then!

*Weaknesses.*  Once gear checks have begun, the corp is often reasonably set up, so finding digging becomes a priority.  This tends to be a large scoring window for the corp.  Naturally, if you don't win early, and especially if you don't get a substantial lead early, any corp teched for late game (e.g. RP) will likely run all over you.  Given the focus on the early game, you need to have an economic back-up plan that will carry you into late.

#### Economy Efficiency

This prototype focuses on a steady build up of board state over time, culminating in cheap, impactful central runs while threatening remotes.  It relies on Kit's ability to prevent the corp from running away with the game early on to get into a later game position of dominance.

#### Economy Denial

This prototype attempts to force early ice rezzes to keep the corp poor, while constantly building.  Early random accesses will yield some points, but an economic lead later on will finish it.

#### Ice Destruction

If Kit doesn't like deep servers, why not kill the ice till they aren't deep anymore!  This is a long-studied prototype that hasn't seen much play recently.


## Kit Economies

This is one of the least interesting aspects of a Kit deck, mainly because there aren't many options.  They are:

1. *Magnum Opus focused.*  A single card to provide all of your economic needs sounds wonderful.  And it is, in the right deck.  The downsides are the constrained memory, the tempo hit early on to get the Opus out, the card slots for the tutors to make that consistent, and the difficulty of balancing both card draw and clicking your Opus.  To approach this challenge, cards that aid in draw are required (Diesel is almost mandatory, and Symmetric Visage or Quality Time are great in different decks).
2. *Resource focused.*  Kati is the staple of many decks, and this would be no different.  Pair that with Daily Casts, Symmetric Visage, and enough events to keep afloat, and you have a decent economic core.
3. *Event focused.*  Kit is not Kate when it comes to leveraging Prepaid Voice Pads, and 3 lucky finds eat up too much of Kit's influence.  Day Jobs are a decent replacement, but are often difficult to use.  Regardless, this *can* work in the right deck, and might even make decent use of Comet (though doubtfully along-side Prepaids, a statement that is being debated on forums as you read this).



## Kit Prototype Deck Construction

Given the different implications, what are the main focuses of Kit?  If we chose a few different styles that Kit wants to play, what are they?

#### Aggression

*What is the deck's main focus?* The core of the deck is

- Cyber-Cypher, ZU.13, or, in some cases, Gordian Blade.
- Maker's Eye
- Legwork

This can be augmented with a number of pressure and disuption cards like Utopia Shard and Imp to slow down the corp.  Siphons have been known to venture into these decks, but given the limited influence, this is a very restrictive option.  Given the emphasis on impactful runs and minimal rig, this deck wants to score agendas fast.  The emphasis in the decoder is that it is cheap enough to get it out and running early.  Once the corp has two layers of ice, and the credits to threaten rezzes, you've lost momentum, and have to dig.  

*How does it handle other contingincies?* The game is rarely won early, but the emphasis is on having a lead going into the later game.  Some combination of the following cards flesh out this next stage.

- Diesel/Quality Time
- R&D Interface
- Modded
- Stimhack

The econ for this style of deck is often based around events to maintain a high tempo early, but without prepaids, it peters out late game.  Thus, the pace of runs slows significantly, so they must remain impactful.  Interesting variants of this use their influence to maintain early pressure via 

- Sneakdoor Beta (often comboed with Nerve Agent for sustained HQ pressure)
- Parasite

Both of these cards force the corp to install and pay for more ice.  Sneakdoor requires protecting another server (two layers of ice), and Parasite eats away existing walls.  Both maintain the early aggression.

Why does this deck attempt to slow down the transition into late game?  Unlike Prepaid Kate, the econ engine doesn't grow over time, and many of the pieces to maintain pressure eat into what would be a remote threatening credit pool.  This means that if glacier makes it to a firm 8 ice on the board, you're in trouble.  Not terminal trouble, as an impactful Maker's Eye run can still win the game, but the number of such runs is quite limited.  This deck often wants to take a hint from Andy and include 

- Kati Jones

To attempt to maintain some late-game, long-lasting economy, Kati is a savior.  Just watch out for those Snatch and Grabs that are running around.

**Match-ups.** As I want this article to be fairly general, and not too specific to any meta, I'll attempt to be fairly general here.  Hate cards that force gear-checks outside of normal ice mechanics (e.g. wraparound) require fast answers.  Metas where all you see are Next Silvers and Ice Walls aside, if you see a deck packing an Inti or two often have some aspect of this prototype.  Cheap ice can ruin your day as two layers can appear quickly, but cheap ice generally has less strength.  Yet another argument for Parasite.  Cheap, high tax ice can hurt early game.  The best example of this is Eli 1.0.  Identifying which ice fall into this category, and including the perfect tools can help.  Atman, though expensive, can maintain pressure through Elis.  Sharpshooter blows throw destroyers.  However, the cost of such tools, and their impact on tempo must be considered.  Corps that require multiple runs per turn (RP and Off the Grid) are actually somewhat OK with this deck.  The emphasis is on 1) centrals, and 2) early game, neither of which are impacted greatly by the multiple run constraints. 

**Anti-synnergies.** If ever there was a deck to *not* put Professional Contacts in, this is it.  Though my previous analysis of ProCons plus event economy in the QuantANR series on stimhack shows that it is a beast, its efficiency as an economic engine should not be considered in a vaccuum.  This deck dies to the multi-turn tempo hit from Professional Contacts.  Though an argument could be made for Opus, it will suffer from the same problems, though to a lesser degree.

#### Economy Efficiency

*What is the deck's main focus?*

*How does it handle other contingincies?*

#### Economy Denial

*What is the deck's main focus?*

*How does it handle other contingincies?*

#### Destruction Kit

*What is the deck's main focus?*

*How does it handle other contingincies?*

## First Principles-based Deck Construction vs. Netdecking

If you enjoy the act of building the decks by considering all posibilities, and choosing a path for which to optimize, then I find an approach based on first priniciples deduced by following the implications starting from the runner identity and their faction to be a productive and fun way of analysing a deck.  Note that this focus is quite different from taking *good cards* and putting them together.  I certainly play with cards that most people don't, but they are in the deck for a reason: to promote the main theme and goals of the deck.  Given the tempo and focus of the deck, an appropriate economic package is chosen.  As new cards are revealed, they can open up new prototypes (e.g. refractor), or they can simply promote existing ones, causing a re-think.
