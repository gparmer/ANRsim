# The Next Generation of Anarch Event-Based Economies

Order and Chaos is going to change things.  Anarch econs are *strong*.  The following are the efficiency changes versus a traditional economic package of Dirty Laundry, Sure Gamble, Lucky Find, Diesel, and Quality Time.  

Economy | Credits/click | Quality draws/click 
--------|---------------|--------------------
SG+DL+LF+DJ+SS+INJ | +0.5 | -0.4
SG+DL+DJ+SS+INJ | |
SG+DL+DJ+SS+INJ+PVP | |

- SG = Sure Gamble
- DL = Dirty Laundry
- LF = Lucky Find
- DJ = Day Job
- SS = Steelskin
- INJ = Inject
- PVP = Prepaid Voice Pad

## *Abstract*

With the new card draw in the form of Steelskin and Inject, and a new event for credit generation in Day Job, the Anarchs are looking to cast off their traditional weaknesses: draw and economy.  Does this add up to an economic powerhouse, or does it track the Anarch history of lagging behind?
