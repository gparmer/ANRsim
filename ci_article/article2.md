# Collateral Damage: Cerebral Imaging in an Adversarial Meta, Part II

In the previous part of this article, I discussed how CI has become a meta and card pool punching bag.  It has had its fast advance ripped away by Clot, and its 7 point in a single turn combo dismantled by Leela and Utopia Shard.  Its plans of killing the runner have been dashed by I've had Worse, and the meta preparing for Blue Sun scorched.  It is, to be clear, in a *bad place*.

Please see Part I of this series for a discussion of the details about why CI is having such a hard time.  The key conclusions are that CI must learn how to use remotes, and has to have a contingency for the rampant ice destruction and turbo-mill decks that are running rampant.  Remotes are, to put it nicely, not CI's forte.  It is an up hill battle, to be sure.

## Next Generation CI

CI must learn remotes.  It has to survive an adversarial meta.  As discussed in Part I, it needs an ice suite that is cheap enough to defend with end-the-run (ETR) early, but also to be quite taxing later on.  A primary deduction we can draw from the ability and strengths of the identity is that it significantly enables combos.  We see a lot of our deck quickly, thus letting us assemble multi-card combos.  How can we design the deck to take advantage of this?  First, lets start defensively:  how can we mount a reasonable defense against all of the current meta-hate?

### Defending against the Haters

Avoiding fast advance dodges much of the hate the current card-pool has brought our favorite punching bag.  However, late-game, high-impact runs, Noise turbo-mill decks, and ice-destruction decks are high-priority weaknesses that require design.

- *Handling late-game, high-impact runs.*  Three cards are king (and queen) for this: (1) Ash, (2) Caprice, and (3) Crisium Grid.  These force multiple runs through defended servers, enabling a late-game "lock" where the runner has no good options.  Crisium Grid neuters Legwork, Account Siphon, and Vamp, thus helping both our early- and late-game.
- *Dealing with the turbo-mill.*  CI cannot hold back on its draws.  It has to draw aggressively to get ice, to get economy, and to fill up its hand to dilute the agendas there.  However, if you don't adapt to 20 of your cards being milled by Noise, you'll likely deck yourself.  Thus cards must be brought in to help handle the mill.  Luckily, a few of these are in faction: Archived Memories and Reclamation Order are no strangers to CI decks.  These can help retrieve agendas when they are milled.  In other match-ups they are often used to recur economy, so aren't dead draws.  Additionally, to avoid milling out, Jackson Howard is helpful (effectively increasing the size of your deck by 9 cards), as is (*gasp*) a larger deck size (e.g. 54).
- *Not folding to ice destruction.*  CI often has a low ice count that enables you to include enough economy and tricks.  However, ice destruction decks can ruin your day.  If we only have a small amount of ice, drawing alone will not be sufficient to lock down our centrals in the presence of aggressive destruction.  We have to be able to get ice back that has been killed.  Luckily, the answer to this is the same as for the previous point: Archived Memories, Reclamation Order, and Jackson Howard.

The number of cards this requires, and the amount of influence it requires should start triggering the spider-sense of any CI player.  Between agendas, ice, and all of these tricks, we likely won't have room for enough operation econ to create a functional CI deck.  Abate your spider tingles!  This deck does *start* a little light on operation economy.  *Later* in the game, our savior, Mr. Jackson helps out by most often placing 3 economy operations back into the deck.  This significantly increases the economy density of your deck over time.

### The Remote

OK, enough with adapting to meta-hate.  I've been skirting the biggest question many readers should have.  *How can we possibly support a remote in CI?*  I'll continue skirting that issue for a few paragraphs, as I discuss something that *doesn't* work.

My first version of this deck included the following:

- Shipment from Mirrormorph (SfMM)
- 3x pieces of big ice (Heimdall/Tollbooth)
- Reversed Accounts (RA)

The idea was to assemble this combo and a bunch of money, throw down two ice and the RA with SfMM, and advance RA twice.  If the runner runs the remote (likely), they're going to spend a lot of credits which hopefully opens subsequent scoring windows.  If they don't break into the server, they're going to lose a lot of credits from RA.  This would hopefully make most runners broke, and open a scoring window to start pushing agendas through the super-remote.

The problem with this idea is that the deck slots used for these (in addition to the ICE, it required 2x the SfMM and 2x RA for consistency) ate into the ability of the deck to defend itself properly before placing the super-remote, and to make money fast enough to threaten the remote early enough.  The latter is doubly a problem as the big ice cost a fortune to rez.  I came to a conclusion after 3 weeks of testing:

*Traditional remotes will not work with this deck.*

So I hit the card binder again and looked for a solution.  I found it in Off the Grid (OtG).

Off the Grid solves a few problems for us:

- It enables remote play.  Plain and simple; we don't need to fast advance to win.  However, we'll call it a "remote-lite".
- It lowers the cost of creating the scoring remote.  OtG costs 6 to rez, which is significantly less than a few large ice (often at least 16 credits), or the old school biotic+biotic+efficiency committee (12 credits).  When playing, it feels refreshingly cheap.  This enables us to go for the throat earlier, and lowers the credit threshold for us to switch modes.

It also synergizes amazingly with a few of the cores of the deck:

- It enables our protection on our centrals (HQ) to be our protection on the remote.  Early investment on not dying (HQ defence) turns into late-game remote defence.
- Our defensive strategy relies on a couple of cards that are best buddies with OtG: Crisium Grid and Carprice.  It is not uncommon for the late-game setup to include both a Caprice and Crisium Grid on HQ (and an Ash on R&D), with OtG in the remote.  The runner must 
 1. get through 4-5 layers of NEXT ice, 
 2. win a psi game (when the corp has plenty of resources), 
 3. trash Crisium Grid, 
 4. make another run through the HQ ice, and 
 5. only *then* run on the OtG server.  
If you lose a psi game -- make another taxing run.  Can't break Excalibur (did I mention the Excalibur on HQ)?  Make all of these runs be at-most one per turn.  If the runner is able to trash Caprice or Crisium, often by going broke, bring 'em back next turn with Archived Memories.  I've even brought back OtG from my heap two times in a game before winning.

This is where the name of the deck comes from.  **CI Lock**, though unimaginative, simply means that once the late-game setup is in place, the corp often has a complete lock on the game.

### Ice: the Few, the Fast, the Strong

What ICE will support this strategy?  We need ice that is quick to get out to stop early Account Siphons, Vamps, and Lampreys, and ice that taxes effectively later to the point where two runs through HQ on the same turn are not viable.  We need only look to the scalability afforded by NEXT ice.  Why are next ice just what the doctor ordered?

1. They're cheap end-the-run (ETR) ice early on (according to [Sutcliffe](http://thesatelliteuplink.blogspot.co.uk/2014/02/shields-up-understanding-ice.html), they are Binary ETR ice).  This solves half the problem.
2. They're quite taxing as more of them get rezzed with a possible, though unlikely, 10 rezzed NEXT ice (thus transforming into Analog ETR ice later).  This solves the other half of the problem.
3. They dissuade the runner from running aggressively early without an estabilished economy as early NEXT rezzes quickly result in terrifyingly strong ice.  This slows many runners down, and lets you dig into your deck, thus becoming richer and stronger.
4. They work best when many of them get out, and their down-side is that you have to draw into many of them for them to scale up to significant strength.  Well, it just so happens that we're the combo indentity, and we draw more than anyone.  NEXT ice are one of the main types of ice that rely on a combo:  NEXT combos with more next.  They are at home in CI.

When going all-in with NEXT ice, it is almost impossible to not also include Mother Goddess which gives us the possibility of up to 10 NEXT ice.  On average, I seem to end the game with around 5 or 6, which is quite sufficient.  

**An aside: additive vs. multiplicative taxation.**  To truly understand the power of NEXT ice, I like to compare what I call *additive* taxation, to *multiplicative* taxation.  Taking a server with two Elis in it, and adding a third is an additive tax on the runner.  A fixed tax is added for a single successful run -- it used to cost 8, now it costs 12 (8 + 4 assuming Corroder).  Adding an Ash to a server is a multiplicative tax as it requires the runner to pay the cost of the server *twice*.  In the two Eli server, it now costs 16 (8 x 2).  Caprice Nisei provides a slightly better multiplicative modifier on average (i.e. > 2).  A Caprice *and* Ash throws the cost to greater than 24 (8 x >3) when protecting agendas.  Next ice is rare among ice in that it provides a multiplicative effect due to its own combo!  Adding the third NEXT silver onto a server results in *each* ice increasing in tax, thus we obtain the additional taxation from the new ice *and* an increase that is proportional to the number of rezzed ice.  The multiplicative factor is less than for Caprice/Ash, but it is better than normal ice.  Thus, as the turns tick by, the intention is that CI is able to increase its taxation multiplicatively, hopefully at some point outpacing the runner's economy.

But why stop with NEXT?  Eli 1.0 is still one of the best ice in the game (filling in as our main Analog Taxing ice).  Sure, Lady is good against it, but line up a few Elis with some NEXT Silvers, and worry no more about how to tax Lady counters.  Eli is great because it is cheap, and taxing.  Exactly what we're looking for.

Given this composition, most ice is cheap (9 ice are 3 or fewer credits), enabling us to aggressively draw and fill out credit pool.  It is weak to ice destruction, but we have the recursion to try and compensate.  

The trade-off that this ice composition makes is that multiple layers of ice are required to protect HQ and R&D (often 4 or more on HQ, and 3 on R&D) which isn't cheap due to install costs.  The important fact:  higher install costs are typically paid later in the game when our economy has developed.  This provides scalable protection: early game, protection is cheap; late game it becomes more expensive, but we should have the credits for it.  Due to the multiplicative impact of NEXT on taxation, higher towers of ice also disproportionally add to the tax.

## Notes on the List

There are a few features of the list that deserve further clarification:

- Snatch and Grab (S&G) - This card consistently kills Kati Jones, Aesop's Pawnshop, and (occasionally) Mr. Lee/Professional Contacts.  It is very powerful to remove their economic capability the turn before you create the remote.  This is a particularly important weapon against Noise.  I've locked out (the point of rage-quit) a Valencia before by recurring S&G killing her Kati.
- Excalibur - This isn't really necessary and is a win-more card in this deck.  However, it is worth the face that you see your opponent make when it is rezzed.
- Subliminal Messaging - I know people don't like this card as a general rule.  It works in this deck.  Once the runner understands the harmful repercussions of rezzed NEXT ice due to "casual runs", they generally slow down their running.   This is a single drip credit every turn if the runner runs at most every other turn (i.e. we have two in the deck).  Given that there are many turns in the game, this is significant and often pays out much higher than a Restructure, with the added benefit of diluting our hand when that is needed (i.e. when scoring).
- Agendas - Corporate War (CW) is an *all-star* in this deck.  It enables you to start scoring using OtG significantly earlier than you would otherwise.  It is an agenda that nearly pays for itself (it costs 4 clicks + 4 credits, and yields 7 credits), thus enabling your credit total to be between around 20 and 30, depending on how much ice is already rezzed, when you trigger the OtG.  NAPD because good.  Scoring order is usually either 1. CW, 2. Priority Requisition (PR), 3. CW/NAPD, or 1. CW, 2. CW, 3. PR.  The first score has to be a four advance agenda because playing OtG is a click. The PR is almost always used to rez a NEXT Gold to add taxation, and beef up the rest of the NEXT.
- 54 cards - I know.  Inefficiency.  Inconsistency.  Throw all the bad terms my way (remember, I'm happy to be a punching bag), but let me justify.  First, against turbo-mill decks, it is difficult to recur agendas, get economy, and progress the agenda-scoring plan with the disruption Noise can bring on.  54 + 9 (Jacksons) has actually been required in many cases.  And when you misplay, you still get decked.  Second, the digging power of the deck compensates for the lower density of influence.  The influence cards are required late-game, by which point you should have found them, but are only beneficial (not required) early on.  The exception is the singleton Caprice that you can't necessarily count on finding.

## Playing for the Lock

If you don't play CI, then you should know that it is strange.  It is like playing a different brand of Netrunner.  Get used to saying "draw" a lot.  The deck goes through three phases:

1. *Early protection, credits, and draw.*  We're vulnerable early to Vamp, Siphon, Wonton Destruction and Legwork.  Given the agenda density, we're less vulnerable to R&D accesses early (16.6% of the deck is agendas).  Thus I will always mulligan for a hand with NEXT Bronze, Silver, or Mother Goddess.  After two layers on HQ (against opponents with a credible thread of any of the HQ-hate cards), then ice goes on R&D.  Often this early phase of R&D accesses is quite a tax on the runner with a low chance of pay-off.  It often doesn't yield much (say 3 points), and uses a lot of clicks.  Second, we build up our credits to the point where they can start significantly outpacing our cards in hand.  It is not uncommon for the first 3 turns to include clicking for credits to get up to Restructure, with our cards in hand 0 to 2 behind our credit total.
2. *Draw and build.* Once our credits start significantly outpacing our cards in hand, we go into turbo-draw mode.  Your drawing for more economy so that you can keep on drawing, ice to build up protection on your servers, and combo pieces.  Many required pieces are low-density.  Compensate for this by drawing a ton.  An ideal turn is 2 draw, 1 economy operation.  The percent of economy operations starts at 27% and increases with every Jackson.  Your proactively placing ice to defend centrals (with an emphasis on getting the NEXT down).  A priority in this phase is getting the Jackons out, and use them to recur economy operations.  After two Jacksons, you've effectively doubled R&D's economy density.
3. *Score out.*  Once you have enough credits to support rezzing all ice on HQ + your HQ upgrades + 7 (OtG + advance) + cards in hand, it is often go-time.  The match-up will tell you how much ice is enough on HQ.  The cost of scoring a CW doesn't change your credit total much after the score, enabling you to push the second out in quick succession if the runner is kept out.  CW is great here as it lets you maintain tempo in this phase.  It is not uncommon, however, to have to take a break between scores to economy up, and recur upgrades and destroyed ice (NEXT Silvers).  If the runners only react to your scoring by the time you're ready to go for the third agenda, then your math changes:  you're able to go for broke, thus encouraging even more ice on HQ, and sometimes an ice on the remote.

*Using Jackson.*  Only play Jacksons in phase 2.  Their use should almost always be either (1) install, rez, draw 4, or if R&D is smaller and you're close to transitioning into phase 3, (2) install.  The latter is just baiting out a run.  In either case they are used to shuffle back in economy by default.  If you need to recur ice, or upgrades, that might take priority.  However, you need to increase your economy density in R&D, and Jackson is your savior for this.

Note that when you're shuffling in with Jackson, you might make what seem like suboptimal decisions:  Leaving two Hedge Funds while shuffling in Blue and Green Level Clearances.  This is often because having 2x a good econ card in Archives is more valuable than having it in your deck.  Reclamation Order increases significantly in value with multiple copies of the retrieved card.

*Defending R&D.*  I've talked quite a bit about HQ defense.  What about R&D?  An Ash, multiple Elis, and one or two NEXT ice (often a Gold) are often sufficient.  Keep track of your agenda count.  You should know at all times how many agendas are in R&D, thus how much you should invest on R&D defense.  Ash is mainly there to prevent deep Medium/Maker's Eye digs when necessary.  Remember that Ash + Crisium anti-synnergizes so Ash is not for HQ.

Keep in mind that either you lose quickly, or there will be a great many turns in a typical game.  To prevent games taking forever, get used to blasting through turns.  I'm partially writing this article so that people can play faster against the deck.

## Matchups

I always mulligan for a hand with cheap ETR ice (NEXT Bronze or Silver) to protect HQ.  Mother Goddess, though more expensive, is a great option as well.  She alone prevents everything other than AI breakers until you decide to defend R&D.  Given her cost, you're often clicking for credits the first and second turn, but can explode afterwards.  Early game credit denial is the quickest way to lose, so protect HQ.

*Matchups:*
- Any matchup that features Sneakdoor Beta *suuucks* for us.  One Sneakdoor run kills OtG.  If you're playing against Leela, Reina, or Gabe, then assume they are using Sneakdoor.  An Eli on archives is mandatory, and keeping backup ice in hand to throw on Archives if needs-be is necessary.  You often want taxation on archives early against Criminal anyway (against Desperado and Security Testing).
- Maxx can be tough, but against Reg-ass Max (aka Minimum Punk Rock) hope to draw your Snatch and Grab to take out Kati, and against Siphon/Eater Maxx, Crisium is the most important card.  You have two Crisiums, and two centrals that can be hammered, for a reason.
- Calimsha Kate (aka cheap-breaker, Prepaid Kate, aka Blitz Kate) is tough as she's geared to get in whenever necessary.  Your NEXT Golds are somewhat useless due to Sharpshooter recursion, but they are a means to tax the clone chips, which is better than having them taxed for Parasites.  Either way, get used to your NEXT Silvers dying to Parasites.  You have recursion for a reason.  In this match-up, you'll need a veritable tower on HQ.  
- Opus Valencia is beyond painful.  Especially if it is the version that love Wyldside + Adjusted Chronotype.  You'll need to take a gamble as to when is the best time to lock.
- Noise...I think I've said enough so far.  Just watch how many cards are in your deck, and realize you need to start scoring when you have about 16 left (counting your Jackson shuffle-ins toward that total) if they focus on around 2 mills per turn.

The meta is in an interesting space with everyone playing and optimizing for RP.  This hurts you because cards that are good against glacier are good against you.  Stimhack, big breakers, huge stealth rigs, etc...  So do the math.  Figure out how many layers of ice you need on HQ with the multiplicative effects of Crisium, Caprice, and Excalibur.  I like this deck, because as long as you know or can guess your opponent's deck, it comes down to math, and optimizing for what is required.  However, any tech in the meta for RP/NEH that focuses on remotes (e.g. Hacktivist Meeting, Astrolabe) impact you significantly less.  Nicely, Clot is a dead-draw.

## A Few Notes on Playing Against the Lock

*Early game.* The runner should force ice rezes early in the game.  The smaller CI's credit pool is, the less aggressively they can draw, thus getting more econ and ice.  Be very aggressive early with a focus on credit denial (not necessarily accesses).  Hear "click for a credit"?  You're winning.  Hear "draw, draw, draw"?  Time to switch modes.

*Later game.* Keep in mind that that the agenda density of this deck actually *decreases* over time due to Jackson shuffling in econ cards (with the exception against Noise).  It is not uncommon to go for the lock when there is a single, or no agendas in the deck.  Focusing on R&D late game only powers up the NEXT ice on HQ.  The density of agendas in HQ late game often approaches 1:3, so you know where to attack.

## Final Thoughts

I know.  I could have just said "Hey all!  CI works well with OtG!" and saved you reading thousands of words.  I think that the process for coming up with new prototypes, and the reasoning behind it, are important.  This deck attempts to make a situation that the runner has difficulty recovering from, an inevitable lock.  Most importantly, it shows that with a little bit of analysis, even CI can be made to exist in a meta that kills its historical scoring mechanisms.  Please post on the forums; I'd appreciate your feedback!

## Variants

I've had many CI decks in the past.  The deck above is a shell that can be adapted in multiple directions.  For the first, I've taken a program destruction variant to a tournament; here's an adaptation of that:

Some CI players are attached to the kill.  This second variant focuses on runner death in a completely different way, while still threatening the Lock:
