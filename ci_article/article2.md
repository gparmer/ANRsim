# RIP Cerebral Imaging; Long Live Cerebral Imaging!  Part 2

In the previous part of this article, I discussed how CI has become a meta and card pool punching bag.  It has had its fast advance ripped away by Clot, and its 7 point in a single turn combo dismantled by Leela and Utopia Shard.  Its plans of killing the runner have been dashed by I've had Worse, and the meta preparing for Blue Sun scorched.  It is, to be clear, in a bad place.

Please see Part 1 of this series for a discussion of the details about why CI is having such a hard time.  The key conclusions are that CI must learn how to use remotes, and has to have a contingency for the rampant ice destruction, and turbo-mill decks that are running rampant.  Remotes are, to put it nicely, not CI's forte.  Ice destruction and turbo-mill are historically  difficult prototypes for CI to handle.  It is an up hill battle, to be sure.

## Next Generation CI

CI must learn remotes.  It has to survive an adversarial meta.  As discussed in Part 1, it needs an ice suite that is cheap enough to defend with end-the-run (ETR) early, but also to be quite taxing later on.  A primary deduction we can draw from the ability and strengths of the identity is that it is made for combos.  We see a lot of our deck, quickly, thus letting us assemble multi-card combos.  How can we design the deck to take advantage of this?  We'll start with a discussion of this ice suite.

### Ice: the Few, the Fast, the Strong

We need ice that is quick to get out to stop early Account Siphons, Vamps, and Lampreys, and ice that taxes effectively later.  We need only look to the scalability afforded by NEXT ice.  Why are next ice just what the doctor ordered?

1. They're cheap end-the-run (ETR) ice early on (according to [Sutcliffe](http://thesatelliteuplink.blogspot.co.uk/2014/02/shields-up-understanding-ice.html), they are Binary ETR ice).  This solves half the problem.
2. They're quite taxing as more of them get rezzed with a possible, though unlikely 10 rezzed NEXT ice (thus transforming into Analog ETR ice later).  This solves the other half of the problem.
3. They dissuade the runner from running aggressively early without an estabilished economy as early NEXT rezzes quickly results in terrifyingly strong ice.  This slows many runners down, and lets you dig into your deck, thus becoming richer and stronger.
4. They work best when many of them get out, and their down-side is that you have to draw into many of them for them to scale up to significant strength.  Well, it just so happens that we're the combo indentiy, and we draw more than anyone.  NEXT ice are one of the main types of ice that rely on a combo:  NEXT combos with more next.  They are at home in CI.

When going all-in with NEXT ice, it is almost impossible to not also include Mother Goddess which gives us the possibility of up to 10 NEXT ice.  On average, I seem to end the game with around 5 or 6, which is quite sufficient.  

To truly understand the power of NEXT ice, I like to compare what I call *additive* taxation, to *multiplicative* taxation.  Taking a server with two Elis in it, and adding a third is an additive tax on the runner.  A fixed tax is added for a single successful run -- it used to cost 8, now it costs 12 (8 + 4 assuming Corroder).  Adding an Ash to a server is a multiplicative tax as it requires the runner to pay the cost of the server *twice*.  In the two Eli server, it now costs 16 (8 x 2).  Caprice Nisei provides a slightly better modified on average if it were truely a 1/3 chance of successfully beating here.  A Caprice *and* Ash throws the cost to greater than 24 (8 x >3) when protecting agendas.  Next ice is rare among ice in that it provides a multiplicative effect due to its own combo!  Adding the third NEXT silver onto a server results in *each* ice increasing in tax, thus we obtain the additional taxation from the new ice *and* an increase that is proportional to the number of rezzed ice.  The multiplicative factor is less than for Caprice/Ash, but it is better than normal ice.

But why stop with NEXT?  Eli 1.0 is still one of the best ice in the game (filling in as our main Analog Taxing ice).  Sure, Lady is good against it, but line up a few Elis with some NEXT Silvers, and worry no more about how to tax Lady counters.  Eli is great because it is cheap, and taxing.  Exactly what we're looking for.  Another potential candidate is Meru Mati, but the influence is hard to fit.

Given this composition, most ice is cheap (9 ice are 3 or fewer credits), enabling us to aggressively draw and fill out credit pool.  The trade-off that this ice composition makes is that multiple layers of ice are required to protect HQ and R&D (often 4 or more on HQ, and 3 on R&D) which isn't cheap due to install costs.  The important fact:  higher install costs are typically paid later in the game when our economy has developed.  This provides scalable protection: early game, protection is cheap; late game it becomes more expensive, but we should have the credits for it.  Due to the multiplicative impact of NEXT on taxation, higher towers of ice also disproportionally add to the tax.

### Defense

Avoiding fast advance dodges much of the hate the current card-pool has brought our favorite punching bag.  However, late-game, high-impact runs, Noise turbo-mill decks, and ice-destruction decks are high-priority weaknesses that require design.

- *Handling late-game, high-impact runs.*  Three cards are king (and queen) for this: (1) Ash, (2) Caprice, and (3) Crisium Grid.  They also add multiplicative taxation factors to our servers, enabling a late-game "lock" where the runner has no good options.  Crisium neuters Legwork, Account Siphon, and Vamp, thus helping both our early- and late-game.
- *Dealing with the turbo-mill.*  CI cannot hold back on its draws.  It has to draw aggressively to get ice, to get economy, and to fill up its hand to dilute the agendas there.  So cards must be brought in to help handle the mill.  Luckily, a few of these are in faction: Archived Memories, and Reclamation Order that are no strangers to CI decks.  These can help retrieve agendas when they are milled.  Additionally, to avoid milling out, Jackson Howard is helpful, as is (*gasp*) a larger deck size.
- *Not folding to ice destruction.*  A major downside to NEXT ice is that Parasite can ruin your day, especially with NEXT Silver at strength 1.  If we only have a small amount of ice, drawing alone will not be sufficient to lock down our centrals in the presence of aggressive destruction.  We have to be able to get ice back that has been killed.  Luckily, the answer to this is the same as for the previous point: Archived Memories, Reclamation Order, and Jackson Howard.

The number of cards this requires, and the amount of influence it requires should start triggering the spider-sense of any CI player.  Between agendas, ice, and all of these tricks, we likely won't have room for enough operation econ to create a functional CI deck.  Abate your spider tingles!  The heap recursion can be used to recur econ when required, and Jacksons - when against non-destruction, non-Noise decks - typically result in a burst of card draw (install, draw two, draw two is common), and three additional economy operations shuffled back into your deck.  When I draw a Jackson, he is often played immediately to increase R&D econ density.  The only exceptions being if we're in an emergency situation, or if we have the room in our hand for the draws.  The heap recursion also enables us to play fewer copies of Ash, Caprice, and Crisium as we can easily get them back if they are trashed.

### The Remote

I've been skirting the biggest question many readers should have.  *How can we possibly support a remote in CI?*  I'll continue skirting that issue for a few paragraphs ;-).

My first version of this deck included the following:

- Shipment from Mirrormorph (SfMM)
- 3x pieces of big ice (Heimdall/Tollbooth)
- Reversed Accounts (RA)

The idea was to assemble this combo and a bunch of money, and throw down two ice, and the RA with SfMM, and advance RA twice.  If the runner runs the remote (likely), they're going to spend a lot of credits, especially to get through.  If they don't they're going to lose a lot of credits.  This would often make most runners broke, and open a scoring window to start pushing agendas through the super-remote.  Agendas included 4x 5/3s (3x Priority Requisition to rez the big ice if they weren't already, and 3x NAPD because good, and 1x Corporate War).

The problem with this idea is that the deck slots used for these (it required 2x the SfMM and 2x RA for consistency) ate into the ability of the deck to defend itself properly before placing the super-remote, and to make money fast enough to threaten the remote early enough.  The latter is doubly a problem as the big ice cost a fortune to rez.  I came to a conclusion after 3 weeks of testing:

*Traditional remotes will not work with this deck.*

So I hit the card binder again and looked for a solution.  I found it in Off the Grid (OtG).

Off the Grid solves a few problems for us:

- It enables remote play.  Plain and simple; we don't need to fast advance to win.
- It lowers the cost of creating the scoring remote.  It costs 6 to rez, which is not nothing.  However, compared to the costs of multiple big ice (16 credits), or biotic+biotic+efficiency committee (12 credits), it seems refreshingly cheap.  This enables us to go for the throat earlier, and lowers the credit threshold for us to switch modes.

It also synergizes amazingly with a few of the cores of the deck:

- It enables our protection on our centrals (HQ) to be our protection on the remote.
- Our defensive strategy relies on a couple of cards that are best buddies with OtG: Crisium Grid and Carprice.  It is not uncommon for the late-game setup to include both a Caprice and Crisium Grid on HQ (and an Ash on R&D), with OtG in the remote.  The runner must get through 4-5 layers of NEXT ice, win a psi game (when the corp has plenty of resources), trash Crisium Grid, make another run through the HQ ice, and *then* run on the OtG server.  If you lose a psi game -- make another taxing run.  Another run before you can trash Crisium.  Can't break Excalibur (did I mention the Excalibur on HQ)?  Make all of these runs be at-most one per turn.  If the runner is able to trash Caprice or Crisium, often by going broke, bring 'em back next turn with Archived Memories.

This is where the name of the deck comes from.  **CI Lock**, though unimaginative, simply means that once the late-game setup is in place, the corp often has a complete lock on the game.

## Notes on the List

There are a few features of the list that deserve further clarification:

- Snatch and Grab - This card consistently kills Kati Jones, Aesop's Pawnshop, and (occasionally) Mr. Lee/Professional Contacts.  It is very powerful to remove their economic capability the turn before you create the remote.  This is a particularly important weapon against Noise.
- Excalibur - This isn't really necessary and is a win-more card in this deck.  +1 Successful Demonstration would be better.  However, it is worth the face that you see your opponent make when it is rezzed.
- Subliminal Messaging - I know people don't like this card as a general rule.  It works in this deck.  Once the runner understands the harmful repercussions of rezzed NEXT ice due to "casual runs", they generally slow down their running.   This is an economic powerhouse against Prepaid Kate that doesn't run often in mid-game, and against Valencia and Noise that often focus on building up.  This is a single drip credit every turn if the runner runs at most every other turn (i.e. we have two in the deck).  Given that there are many turns in the game, this is significant and often pays out higher than a Restructure.
- Agendas - Corporate War (CW) is an *all-star* in this deck.  It enables you to start scoring using OtG significantly earlier than you would otherwise.  It is an agenda that nearly pays for itself (it costs 4 clicks + 4 credits, and yields 7 credits), thus enabling your credit total to be between around 20 and 30, depending on how much ice is already rezzed, when you trigger the OtG.  NAPD because good.  A valid argument could be +1 NAPD, -1 CW.  I like the consistency of starting to score earlier with two CWs.  Scoring order is usually either CW, Priority Requisition (PR), CW/NAPD, or CW, CW, PR.  The PR is almost always used to rez a NEXT Gold to add taxation, and beef up the rest of the NEXT.  Two CWs are scored early if ice is sufficiently taxing, and you want to start scoring earlier.  The PR is scored second (or sometimes first) if more taxation is desperately required, and the impact of the NEXT Gold will be instrumental in that.  You might score the Hades Fragment first or second if you're against Noise turbo-mill to release some pressure.  That said, I've never scored it in this deck.
- 54 cards - I know.  Inefficiency.  Inconsistency.  Throw all the bad terms my way (remember, I'm happy to be a punching bag), but let me justify.  First, against turbo-mill decks, it is difficult to recur agendas, get economy, and progress the agenda-scoring plan with the disruption Noise can bring on.  54 + 9 (Jacksons) has actually been required in many cases.  The same applies to ice destruction decks that pressure your credits, and slow down your game-plan.  Second, the digging power of the deck compensates for the lower density of influence.  The influence cards are required late-game, by which point you should have found them, but are only beneficial (not required) early on.  The exception is the singleton Caprice that you can't count on finding.  However, she's somewhat superfluous with the Crisium and HQ tax.

## Playing for the Lock

If you don't play CI, then you should know that it is strange.  It is like playing a different brand of Netrunner.  Get used to saying "draw" a lot.  The deck goes through three phases:

1. *Early protection, credits, and draw.*  We're vulnerable early to Vamp, Siphon, Wonton Destruction and Legwork.  Given the agenda density, we're less vulnerable to R&D accesses early (16.6% of the deck is agendas).  Thus I will always mulligan for a hand with NEXT Bronze, Silver, or Mother Goddess.  After two layers on HQ (against opponents with a credible thread of any of the HQ-hate cards), then ice goes on R&D.  Often this early phase of R&D access is quite a tax on the runner.  It often doesn't yield much (say 3 points), and uses a lot of clicks.  Second, we build up our credits to the point where they can start outpacing our cards in hand.  It is not uncommon for the first 3 turns to include clicking for credits to get up to Restructure, with our cards in hand 1-2 behind our credit total.
2. *Draw and build.* Once our credits start significantly outpacing our cards in hand, we go into turbo-draw mode.  Your drawing for more economy so that you can keep on drawing, ice to build up protection on your servers, and combo pieces.  An ideal turn is 3 draw, 1 economy operation.  The percent of economy operations starts at 27% and increases with every Jackson.  Your proactively placing ice to defend centrals (with an emphasis on getting the NEXT down).  A priority in this phase is getting the Jackons out, and use them to recur economy operations.  After two Jacksons, you've effectively doubled R&D's economy density.
3. *Score out.*  Once you have enough credits to support rezzing all ice on HQ + your HQ upgrades + 7 (OtG + advance) + cards in hand, it is often go-time.  The match-up will tell you how much ice is enough on HQ.  The cost of scoring a CW doesn't change your credit total much after the score, enabling you to push the second out in quick succession if the runner is kept out.  CW is great here as it lets you maintain tempo in this phase.  It is not uncommon, however, to have to take a break between scores to economy up, and recur upgrades and destroyed ice (NEXT Silvers).  If the runners only react to your scoring by the time you're ready to go for the third agenda, then your math changes:  you're able to go for broke, thus encouraging even more ice on HQ.

*Using Jackson.*

*Defending R&D.*

To play the ice, and rez the ice, and to continue to draw, you need credits.  To get credits, you draw.  When you draw, you find your (low-density) ice.  Aggressive draws are what make the deck work.  Otherwise ice destruction and Account Siphons wreck face.  The ideal turn is 3 draw, 1 econ card (note the percent of economy cards to total cards is 27%, which increases with each Jackson).  We deviate from this (1) to install ice when defense is required -- and being proactive in your defense rather than reactive is required, as installing ice after the vamp doesn't help; (2) install upgrades for defense; (3) if we need to recur economy cards, ice, or agendas; and (4) when we're going for the lock.  

We focus on defending HQ first, at the risk of bleeding accesses from R&D because the fastest way to lose is to let the runner in to HQ early.  Siphons, Vamps, Wonton Destructions, and Imps all destroy CI early.  The only time I put the second ice on R&D is if a Medium appears.  It is quite common to bleed 3-4 points early on out of R&D.  This is expected.  Getting an Ash on R&D is a great way to tax and prevent bleeding.  However, remember that only 16.6% of your deck is agendas, so runs on R&D are pretty taxing (i.e. clicks for little pay-off).

Jacksons have a simple job in the deck.  Increase the density of economy in the deck, or help recur ice/agendas against specific decks.  Given this, we typically want to play it ASAP.  If you find yourself in an overabundance of ice, it is worthwhile to protect Jackson with either a NEXT Silver or Bronze.  Either the corp ignores it, and you get efficient draw, or they run it, and power up your other NEXT ice.  Later, you can use that server for the OtG for a minor amount of additional protection if they blow up the OtG.  Note that when you're shuffling in with Jackson, you might make what seem like suboptimal decisions:  Leaving two Hedge Funds while shuffling in Blue and Green Level Clearances.  This is often because having 2x a good econ card in Archives is more valuable than having it in your deck.  Reclamation Order increases significantly in value with multiple copies of the retrieved card.  Similarly, when facing off against ice destruction, waiting till you have two copies of NEXT Silver in Archives before getting both back is often the right call assuming you have enough ice to compensate in the mean time.

As this is a combo deck, drawing gets our combo pieces.  At the bare minimum, we need OtG, Crisium Grid, enough ice on HQ to keep the runner out for two runs through HQ, and enough money to rez both that ice and Crisium + OtG (9).  Adding Caprice or Excalibur onto HQ are bonuses, and an early draw of Caprice and significantly speed up the lock.  In such a case, and depending on the runner, trying to lock with only 2-3 ice on HQ can be reasonable.  Even if they trash OtG, you have archive recursion to bring it back.

Keep in mind that either you lose quickly, or there will be a great many turns in a typical game.  To prevent games taking forever, get used to blasting through turns.  I'm partially writing this article so that people can play faster against the deck ;-).

## Matchups and Playing Against the Lock

The focus against this deck should be trying to win early.  If that isn't feasible, make sure that you force a lot of ice rezzes.  This is the most important point.  Though this does power up the NEXT ice, it also slows down the corp a huge amount.  Without rezzing, the "Draw. Draw. Draw...." phases come quickly, and frequently.  When you hear a lot of "Draw", that's when you know your likely losing.  If you ever hear "click for credit", or if the corp discards at the end of their turn, you are absolutely winning.

I always mulligan for a hand with cheap ETR ice (NEXT Bronze or Silver) to protect HQ.  Mother Goddess, though more expensive, is a great option as well.  She alone prevents everything other than AI breakers until you decide to defend R&D.  Given her cost, you're often clicking for credits the first and second turn, but can explode afterwards.

Keep in mind that that the agenda density of this deck actually *decreases* over time due to Jackson shuffling in econ cards (with the exception against Noise).  It is not uncommon to go for the lock when there is a single, or no agendas in the deck.  Focusing on R&D late game only powers up the NEXT ice on HQ.  As I've mentioned before, the density of agendas in HQ late game often approaches 1:3, so you know where to attack.

Any matchup that features Sneakdoor Beta *suuucks* for us.  One Sneakdoor run kills OtG.  If you're playing against Leela, Reina, or Gabe, then assume they are using Sneakdoor.  An Eli on archives is mandatory, and keeping backup ice in hand to throw on Archives if needs-be is necessary.  Maxx can be tough, but against Reg-ass Max (aka Minimum Punk Rock) hope to draw your Snatch and Grab to take out Kati, and against Siphon/Eater Maxx, Crisium is the most important card.  You have two Crisiums, and two centrals that can be hammered, for a reason.  Calimsha Kate (aka cheap-breaker, Prepaid Kate) is tough as she's geared to get in whenever necessary.  Your NEXT Golds are somewhat useless due to Sharpshooter recursion, but they are a means to tax the clone chips, which is better than having them taxed for Parasites.  Either way, get used to your NEXT Silvers dying to Parasites.  You have recursion for a reason.  In this match-up, you'll need a veritable tower on HQ.  Opus Valencia is beyond painful.  Especially if it is the version that love Wyldside + Adjusted Chronotype.  You'll need to take a gamble as to when is the best time to lock.

The meta is in an interesting space with everyone playing and optimizing for RP.  This hurts you because cards that are good against glacier are good against you.  Stimhack, big breakers, huge stealth rigs, etc...  So do the math.  Figure out how many layers of ice you need on HQ with the multiplicative effects of Crisium, Caprice, and Excalibur.  I like this deck, because as long as you know or can guess your opponent's deck, it comes down to math, and optimizing for what is required.  However, any tech for RP/NEH that focuses on remotes (e.g. Hacktivist Meeting) impact you significantly less.

## Possible Modifications

The slots that are somewhat malleable are:

- Excalibur - Really this is in there for entertainment factor.  I can't say it has won any games.  But it feels too good to rez to cut.
- Snatch and Grab - I'd highly advise against removing it, and would prefer it being x2 for consistency.  This is a meta call, but right now it is strong in the meta.
- 1x Ash - With all of the Anarch R&D deep dig out there 2x is needed for consistency.  Otherwise, R&D is good at defending itself after a Jackson or two.
- -1 Ash, +1 Corporate Troubleshooter (CT) - An earlier version of this deck used CT.  NEXT Gold + CT is great.  However, it is inconsistent, and easily handled by Faerie and Sharpshooter.
- -1 CW, +1 NAPD - increased resiliency for a decrease in consistency for getting what is usually the first agenda you want to score.
- -1-3x CW, +1-3 Mandatory Upgrades (MU) - I don't doubt that MU could be scored.  I doubt that it is worth the pain when you will likely win in a few turns anyway.

Slots that I'm sure people will modify, but I would recommend against:

- Subliminal Messaging - A good econ card in this deck.  It is more consistent than any of the other operation economy alternatives (Successful Demonstration or Peak Efficiency), and fills the hole of consistent drip econ.
- -NEXT Ice, +Anything else - Nope.  No ice scales like NEXT.  Bioroids are more expensive, and porous to high-impact early runs that lose you games.  Yes, NEXT is vulnerable to Parasite.  That's half the reason we have so much Archives recursion, and Jacksons.  Their destruction taxes your recursion.  Your ice recursion stresses their Parasite recursion.  And you have both more draw, and more money that they likely do.

## Final Thoughts

I know.  I could have just said "Hey all!  CI works well with OtG!" and saved you reading thousands of words.  I think that the process for coming up with new prototypes, and the reasoning behind it, are important.  This deck attempts to make a situation that the runner has difficulty recovering from, an inevitable lock.  Most importantly, it shows that with a little bit of analysis, even CI can be made to exist in a meta that kills its historical scoring mechanisms.  Please post on the forums; I'd appreciate your feedback!
