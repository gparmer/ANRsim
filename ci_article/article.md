# RIP Cerebral Imaging; Long Live Cerebral Imaging!

I have a confession to make:  I am a serial Cerebral Imaging (CI) player.  It is clear that we aren't seeing much CI being played currently, and haven't for a while.  I'll go over why I believe this is, and what can be done to make CI somewhat viable again.

Cerebral Imaging has a storied history as a kill-deck, or a combo-deck.  These prototypes are natural from the two main features of most CI decks:

1. Massive hand sizes often facilitated by a huge of amount of R&D digging.
2. Massive credit pools required by the massive hand sizes.

Since there is little pressure on the corp to put agendas out of their hand into remotes, most builds go remote-less.  Though some builds that focus on speed (7 points in one turn combos) put less of an emphasis on these (often staying around 13 cards and credits), many builds explode through operations up to 30+ credits.

I don't think that this article will make CI a tier 1 deck, but I do think it represents an interesting study in card interactions, and that the build is better than any of the popular CI decks.

## A Brief History of CI Builds

[PeekaySK](http://stimhack.com/cerebral-imaging-the-evolution-of-an-identity/) has done a great overview of the evolution of the CI prototypes over time, and I'm only going to review what he says briefly.  He does a much more thorough job than I, so please read that article.  He describes the CI builds clustering around:

> Taxing ICE, reasonably low agenda density in RnD (which only decreases as agendas are drawn and held in HQ), Operations-powered economy, Fast-Advance as a primary scoring mechanism (either eschewing remotes completely, or only using temporary ones), a fair amount of recursion for the key pieces. Gigantic hand size is used both to decrease the likelihood of agendas being stolen out of HQ, and to hold multi-card combos.

Briefly, a few of the CI builds he discusses:

- *Tag-n-bag.* Splashing Scorched Earths, and SEA Source, combined with a strong operation economy threatens runner death-by-nuke from a very early point in the game onward.  To play against this, the runner must often slow down and econ up (or dig for Plascretes).  This enables CI to do the same, which is where it wants to be:  avoiding early game runner aggro.

- *Accelerated Diagnostics + Power Shutdown combos.*  When you see this deck win once, you're impressed.  Then you never want to see it again.  It feels somewhat degenerate and "game breaking" that 7 points can be scored in a single turn, and I've seen the combo go off as early as turn 3 (thanks Dan for streaming).

- *Fast-advance variants.* Many of these feature Efficiency Committee scored with a double Biotic Labor, that is subsequently used with Shipment from San San to score a 5/3.   The game is finished with a third biotic on a 3/2.   This deck has to have a significant bank to pull off the 12 credit initial biotic+biotic+4 advance Efficiency Committee score.

Enough with review.  Why has this deck seen a slow death over the past half year?

## The Death of CI

What has killed each of these prototypes?

- *RIP tag-and-bag.*  A combination of the rise of Blue Sun that has forced people to tech for rich corporations that want to burn your house down.  Runners are running fairly rich, so Sea Sourcing a prepared runner is no longer a trivial matter.  Additionally, Anarchs got their answer to nuclear death in I've Had Worse.  The first scorch typically has at least a 4/5 chance of drawing the three additional cards required to survive the second scorch.  Not good odds to base your entire game-plan on.

- *RIP combo-wombo.*  Three cards straight-up kill this prototype:  Utopia Shard, Leela Patel, and Clot, all of which see some competitive play.  Leela Patel doesn't make it impossible for the combo to go off, just significantly more unlikely.  Utopia Shard and Clot (fetched during the combo) straight up kill it.

- *RIP fast-advance.* The masses are fleeing from Near-Earth Hub (NEH) to Replicating Perfection because of Clot.  Though it seems a minority of players are using Clot, when you face off against one of them with a fast-advance CI deck, your main game-plan is gone.  While Clot is in the meta, this prototype is not going be doing very well.

A few other factors have made CI's life quite a bit more difficult.  These include:

- *Turbo-mill.*  The general focus on increased R&D disruption through the increased prevalence of Noise has made digging aggressively into your deck a risky proposition.  This emphasizes your need for recursion facilities.

- *Ice destruction.* The increased capability to peel your ice off of your centrals both with the Cutlery, and with the renewed interest in Parasite and Clone Chip (often in Noise, Reina Roja, and Maxx) put pressure on your ability to raise the funds to maintain a large hand size *and* do what you need to to progress your game-plan.  Most CI decks run relatively ICE-light to make room for you operation econ, and this pressures you to increase the ICE count...but will you have the money to rez it?

- *Om-nom-nom.*  Eater decks can be quite painful.  They often feature both significant ice destruction (see above), *and* can get in with powerful events without gear checks.  Account Siphons and Vamps are the bane of CI, and these decks can get in with them.

- *R&D deep-dig.*  Noise and Valencia decks focused on Hive Mind, Incubator, and multiple Mediums are an issue.  The runner need only get into R&D once to see upwards of 20 cards.  CI is typically a late-game deck, so these decks must be dealt with.

Really, when imagining the current state of CI, it is useful to think of a punching bag, dented deep by the malice of the meta and the capriciousness of the current card pool.

But like I said before:  I'm a serial CI player.  And I don't mind being a punching bag.

## NEXT Generation CI

Deck building can be hard.  Especially when your buildling material is a punching bag.  I'm going to take a specific approach to try to innovate CI.  I won't go into the details of the methodology here (I'll write about it in the future), but it involves analysing the fundamental implications stemming directly from the identity, identifying prototypes that follow from those implications, and constructing a deck from cards that strengthen the prototype, and cards that store up its weaknesses.  There's nothing new here, but the approach is very methodological, which seems to force innovation.

*What does the ID tell us?* At the risk of repeating myself, it tells us that we want lots of cards in HQ, and to do so, require lots of credits.  If we don't keep lots of cards in hand, then why aren't we playing Engineering the Future (ETF)?  Ahh the HB curse.  The prototypes above focus around both combos due to the large hand size, and using lots of credits to score out of hand.  Lets define a new prototype for CI, and try and make it work: a CI -- *gasp* -- **with remotes**!

Why are CI decks with remotes quite rare?  Lets push first into this prototype's weaknesses:

- *RIP fast-advance.* Clot makes running a traditional CI deck too risky due to the auto-lose potential.  *Conclusion:* We must find a way to move our game to remotes.

- *Ice requirements.*  To have enough money and draw in the deck, many card slots are required for operation economy.  This typically crowds out the slots for Ice.  With fewer slots for ice, defending remotes becomes difficult.  Fewer ice slots makes the balance between early-game ice to stop game-ending Account Siphons, and late-game taxing ice all the more difficult. This balance is essential against most runners, and necessary, but not sufficient, to survive Eater decks.  *Conclusion:* We need a small ice suite that is both quick to keep aggressive plays out, yet taxing enough in the late-game to avoid bleeding agendas from HQ and, to a lesser extent, R&D.  If we have fewer ice, we also need a way to handle ice-destruction decks.

- *Bleeding from HQ.*  The typical way to beat CI is to get early agendas from R&D, and late-game use Legworks to snatch them from HQ.  If we are putting resources into defending a remote, this problem will only get worse.  This makes sense as the agenda density in HQ often approaches 1/3 late game as signficant portions of the deck's ice and operation are played.  *Conclusion:* We need to lessen the impact of the rare late-game, high-impact runs.

- *Turbo-milling + turbo-drawing.* Running out of cards in R&D is a real risk in CI decks.  Many include 3 Blue Level Clearances, 3 Green Level Clearances, and draw a few times a turn.  Noise loves to see this.  Without the draw, it can be difficult to have the required economy.  *Conclusion:*  We need to either avoid drawing as much as CI wants to do which contradicts the fundamental implications that follow from the identity, or mitigate the damage from mills, and win fast enough to not lose by milling.

- *Adversity to asset-based economy.*  Asset-based economy has a fundamental issue:  it is difficult to rez the asset economy early game, while maintaining enough credits to both defend centrals and keep a credit pool commensurate with your hand-size.  Early game is weakened in an id where early game is already dicey.  I've used decks that use a full complement of operation econ additionally including asset-based econ.  This leads to you being rich, or the runner being poor (from trashing many Eve Campaigns and Pad Campaigns), but removes slots in your deck for reliably scoring out. *Conclusion:* We don't need any more pressure on the already-pressured deck slots, and retreating to assets seems counter-productive.  I've tried to shore up this weakness, and failed many times.

What *still* works in CI?  Combos haven't gone away, and the ability to relatively quickly raise huge amounts of money from operations survives.

### Ice: the Few, the Fast, the Strong

We need ice that is quick to get out to stop early Account Siphons, Vamps, and Lampreys, and ice that taxes effectively later.  We need only look to the scalability afforded by NEXT ice.  Why are next ice just what the doctor ordered?

1. They're cheap end-the-run (ETR) ice early on.  This solves half the problem.
2. They're quite taxing as more of them get rezzed (maximum 10 strength or 10 subroutines is nothing to sneeze at).  This solves the other half of the problem.
3. They dissuade the runner from running aggressively early without an estabilished economy as many early rezzes quite quickly results in terrifyingly strong ice.  This slows many runners down, and lets you dig into your deck, thus becoming richer and stronger.

When going all-in with NEXT ice, it is almost impossible to not also include Mother Goddess which gives us the possibility of up to 10 NEXT ice.  On average, I seem to end the game with around 5 or 6, which is quite sufficient.  To truly understand the power of NEXT ice, I like to compare what I call *additive* taxation, to *multiplicative* taxation.  Taking a server with two Elis in it, and adding a third is an additive tax on the runner.  A fixed tax is added for a single successful run -- it used to cost 8, now it costs 12 (8 + 4 assuming Corroder).  Adding an Ash to a server is a multiplicative tax as it requires the runner to pay the cost of the server *twice*.  In the two Eli server, it now costs 16 (8 * 2).  Caprice Nisei provides a slightly better modified on average if it were truely a 1/3 chance of successfully beating here.  A Caprice *and* Ash throws the cost to greater than 24 (8 * >3).  Next ice is rare among ice in that it provides a multiplicative effect on its own!  Adding the third NEXT silver onto a server results in *each* ice increasing in tax, thus we obtain the additional taxation from the new ice *and* an increase that is proportional to the number of rezzed ice.

But why stop with NEXT?  Eli 1.0 is still one of the best ice in the game.  Sure, Lady is good against it, but line up a few Elis with some NEXT Silvers, worry no more about effectively taxing Lady counters.  Eli is great because it is cheap, and taxing.  Exactly what we're looking for.  Another potential candidate is Meru Mati, but the influence is hard to fit.

Given this composition, most ice is cheap (9 are 3 or less).  The trade-off that this ice composition makes is that multiple layers of ice are required to protect HQ and R&D (often 4 on HQ, and 3 on R&D) which isn't cheap due to install costs.  The important fact:  higher install costs are typically paid later in the game when our economy has developed.  This provides scalable protection: early game, protection is cheap; late game it becomes more expensive, but we should have the credits for it.  Due to the multiplicative impact of NEXT on taxation, higher towers of ice also disproportionally add to the tax.

### Defense

Avoiding fast advance dodges much of the hate the current card-pool has brought our favorite punching bag.  However, late-game, high-impact runs, Noise turbo-mill decks, and ice-destruction decks are high-priority weaknesses that require design.

- *Handling late-game, high-impact runs.*  Three cards are king (and queen) for this: (1) Ash, (2) Caprice, and (3) Crisium Grid.  They also add multiplicative taxation factors to our servers, enabling a late-game "lock" where the runner has no good options.  Crisium neuters Legwork, Account Siphon, and Vamp, thus helping both our early- and late-game.
- *Dealing with the turbo-mill.*  CI cannot hold back on its draws.  It has to draw aggressively to get ice, to get economy, and to fill up its hand to dilute the agendas there.  So cards must be brought in to help handle the mill.  Luckily, a few of these are in faction: Archived Memories, and Reclamation Order that are no strangers to CI decks.  These can help retrieve agendas when they are milled.  Additionally, to avoid milling out, Jackson Howard is helpful, as is a (*gasp*) larger deck size.
- *Not folding to ice destruction.*  If we only have a small amount of ice, drawing alone will not be sufficient to get more protection.  We have to be able to get ice back that has been killed.  Luckily, the answer to this is the same as for the previous point: Archived Memories, Relamation Order, and Jackson Howard.

The number of cards this requires, and the amount of influence it requires should start triggering the spider-sense of any CI player.  Between agendas, ice, and all of these tricks, we likely won't have room for enough operation econ to create a functional CI deck.  Abate your spider tingles!  The heap recursion can be used to recur econ when required, and Jacksons for non-destruction, non-Noise decks typically result in a burst of card draw (install, draw two, draw two is common), and three additional economy operations in your deck (when he does his recur-think).  When I draw a Jackson, he is often played immediately to increase R&D econ density.  The only exceptions being if we're in an emergency situation, or if we have the room in our hand for the draws.  The heap recursion also enables us to play fewer copies of Ash, Caprice, and Crisium as we can easily get them back if they are trashed.

### The Remote

I've been skirting the biggest question many readers may have.  *How can we possibly support a remote in CI?*  I'll continue skirting that issue for a paragraph ;-).

My first version of this deck included the following:

- Shipment from Mirrormorph (SfMM)
- 3x pieces of big ice (Heimdall/Tollbooth)
- Reversed Accounts (RA)

The idea was to assemble this combo and a bunch of money, and throw down two ice, and the RA with SfMM, and advance RA twice.  If the runner runs the remote (likely), they're going to spend a lot of credits.  If they don't they're going to lose a lot of credits.  This would often make most runners broke, and open a scoring window to start pushing agendas through the super-remote.  Agendas included 4x 5/3s (3x Priority Requisition to rez the big ice if they weren't already, and 3x NAPD because good, and 1x Corporate War).

The problem with this idea is that the deck slots used for these (it required 2x the SfMM and 2x RA for consistency) ate into the ability of the deck to defend itself properly before placing the super-remote, and to make money fast enough to threaten the remote early enough.  The latter is doubly a problem as the big ice cost a fortune to rez.  I came to a conclusion after 3 weeks of testing:

*Traditional remotes will not work with this deck.*

So I hit netrunnerdb again and looked for a solution.  I found it in Off the Grid (OtG).

Off the Grid solves a few problems for us:

- It enables remote play.  Plain and simple; we don't need to fast advance to win.
- It lowers the cost of creating the scoring remote.  It costs 6 to rez, which is not nothing.  However, compared to the costs of multiple big ice, or biotic+biotic+efficiency committee, it seems refreshingly cheap.  This enables us to go for the throat earlier, and lowers the credit threshold for us to switch modes.

It also synergizes amazingly with a few of the cores of the deck:

- The barrier to accessing the remote's agendas is getting through HQ, which is often the server we focus most on building up.
- Our defensive strategy relies on a couple of cards that are best buddies with OtG: Crisium Grid and Carprice.  It is not uncommon for the late-game setup to include both a Caprice and Crisium Grid on HQ (and an Ash on R&D), with OtG in the remote.  The runner must get through 4-5 layers of NEXT ice, win a psi game (when the corp has plenty of resources), trash Crisium Grid, make another run through the HQ ice, and *then* run on the OtG server.  If you lose a psi game -- make another taxing run.  Another run before you can trash Crisium.  Can't break Excalibur (did I mention the Excalibur on HQ)?  Make all of these runs be at-most one per turn.  If the runner is able to trash Caprice or Crisium, often by going broke, bring 'em back next turn with Archived Memories.

This is where the name of the deck comes from.  **CI Lock**, though unimaginative, simply means that once the late-game setup is in place, the corp often has a complete lock on the game.

## Notes on the List

There are a few features of the list that deserve further clarification:

- Snatch and Grab - This card consistently kills Kati Jones, Aesop's Pawnshop, and (occasionally) Mr. Lee/Professional Contacts.  It is very powerful to remove their economic capability the turn before you create the remote.  This is a particularly important weapon against Noise.
- Excalibur - This isn't really necessary and is a win-more card in this deck.  +1 Successful Demonstration would be better.  However, it is worth the face that you see your opponent make when it is rezzed.
- Subliminal Messaging - I know people don't like this card as a general rule.  It works in this deck.  Once the runner understands the harmful repercussions of rezzed NEXT ice due to "casual runs", they generally slow down their running.   This is an economic powerhouse against Prepaid Kate that doesn't run often in mid-game, and against Valencia and Noise that often focus on building up.  This is a single drip credit every turn if the runner runs at most every other turn (i.e. we have two in the deck).  Given that there are many turns in the game, this is significant and often pays out higher than a Restructure.
- Agendas - Corporate War (CW) is an *all-star* in this deck.  It enables you to start scoring using OtG significantly earlier than you would otherwise.  It is an agenda that nearly pays for itself (it costs 4 clicks + 4 credits, and yields 7 credits), thus enabling your credit total to be between around 20 and 30, depending on how much ice is already rezzed, when you trigger the OtG.  NAPD because good.  A valid argument could be +1 NAPD, -1 CW.  I like the consistency of starting to score earlier with two CWs.  Scoring order is usually either CW, Priority Requisition (PR), CW/NAPD, or CW, CW, PR.  The PR is almost always used to rez a NEXT Gold to add taxation, and beef up the rest of the NEXT.  Two CWs are scored early if ice is sufficiently taxing, and you want to start scoring earlier.  The PR is scored second (or sometimes first) if more taxation is desperately required, and the impact of the NEXT Gold will be instrumental in that.  You might score the Hades Fragment first or second if you're against Noise turbo-mill to release some pressure.  That said, I've never scored it in this deck.
- 54 cards - I know.  Inefficiency.  Inconsistency.  Throw all the bad terms my way (remember, I'm happy to be a punching bag), but let me justify.  First, against turbo-mill decks, it is difficult to recur agendas, get economy, and progress the agenda-scoring plan with the disruption Noise can bring on.  54 + 9 (Jacksons) has actually been required in many cases.  The same applies to ice destruction decks that pressure your credits, and slow down your game-plan.  Second, the digging power of the deck compensates for the lower density of influence.  The influence cards are required late-game, by which point you should have found them, but are only beneficial (not required) early on.  The exception is the singleton Caprice that you can't count on finding.  However, she's somewhat superfluous with the Crisium and HQ tax.

## Playing for the Lock

If you don't play CI, then you should know that it is strange.  It is like playing a different brand of Netrunner.  Your priorities generally follow:

1. Get a layer of ETR ice over HQ.
2. Draw.  Draw.  Draw.
3. Get a second layer of ETR ice over HQ.
4. Draw.  Draw.  Draw.
5. Ice R&D.
6. Draw.  Draw.  Draw.  Draw.  Draw.  Draw.
7. Goto 6.
8. Push out the lock when appropriate.

To play the ice, and rez the ice, and to continue to draw, you need credits.  To get credits, you draw.  When you draw, you find your (low-density) ice.  Aggressive draws are what make the deck work.  Otherwise ice destruction and Account Siphons wreck face.  The ideal turn is 3 draw, 1 econ card (note the percent of economy cards to total cards is 27%, which increases with each Jackson).  We deviate from this (1) to install ice when defense is required -- and being proactive in your defense rather than reactive is required, as installing ice after the vamp doesn't help; (2) install upgrades for defense; (3) if we need to recur economy cards, ice, or agendas; and (4) when we're going for the lock.  

We focus on defending HQ first, at the risk of bleeding accesses from R&D because the fastest way to lose is to let the runner in to HQ early.  Siphons, Vamps, and Imps all destroy CI early.  The only time I put the second ice on R&D is if a Medium appears.  It is quite common to bleed 2-3 points early on.  This is expected.  Getting an Ash on R&D is a great way to tax and prevent bleeding.

Jacksons have a simple job in the deck.  Increase the density of economy in the deck, or help recur ice/agendas against specific decks.  Given this, we typically want to play it ASAP.  If you find yourself in an overabundance of ice, it is worthwhile to protect Jackson with either a NEXT Silver or Bronze.  Either the corp ignores it, and you get efficient draw, or they run it, and power up your other NEXT ice.  Later, you can use that server for the OtG for a minor amount of additional protection if they blow up the OtG.  Note that when you're shuffling in with Jackson, you might make what seem like suboptimal decisions:  Leaving two Hedge Funds while shuffling in Blue and Green Level Clearances.  This is often because having 2x a good econ card in Archives is more valuable than having it in your deck.  Reclamation Order increases significantly in value with multiple copies of the retrieved card.  Similarly, when facing off against ice destruction, waiting till you have two copies of NEXT Silver in Archives before getting both back is often the right call assuming you have enough ice to compensate in the mean time.

As this is a combo deck, drawing gets our combo pieces.  At the bare minimum, we need OtG, Crisium Grid, enough ice on HQ to keep the runner out for two runs through HQ, and enough money to rez both that ice and Crisium + OtG (9).  Adding Caprice or Excalibur onto HQ are bonuses, and an early draw of Caprice and significantly speed up the lock.  In such a case, and depending on the runner, trying to lock with only 2-3 ice on HQ can be reasonable.  Even if they trash OtG, you have archive recursion to bring it back.

Keep in mind that either you lose quickly, or there will be a great many turns in a typical game.  To prevent games taking forever, get used to blasting through turns.  I'm partially writing this article so that people can play faster against the deck ;-).

## Matchups and Playing Against the Lock

The focus against this deck should be trying to win early.  If that isn't feasible, make sure that you force a lot of ice rezzes.  This is the most important point.  Though this does power up the NEXT ice, it also slows down the corp a huge amount.  Without rezzing, the "Draw. Draw. Draw...." phases come quickly, and frequently.  When you hear a lot of "Draw", that's when you know your likely losing.  If you ever hear "click for credit", or if the corp discards at the end of their turn, you are absolutely winning.

I always mulligan for a hand with cheap ETR ice (NEXT Bronze or Silver) to protect HQ.  Mother Goddess, though more expensive, is a great option as well.  She alone prevents everything other than AI breakers until you decide to defend R&D.  Given her cost, you're often clicking for credits the first and second turn, but can explode afterwards.

Keep in mind that that the agenda density of this deck actually *decreases* over time due to Jackson shuffling in econ cards (with the exception against Noise).  It is not uncommon to go for the lock when there is a single, or no agendas in the deck.  Focusing on R&D late game only powers up the NEXT ice on HQ.  As I've mentioned before, the density of agendas in HQ late game often approaches 1:3, so you know where to attack.

Any matchup that features Sneakdoor Beta *suuucks* for us.  One Sneakdoor run kills OtG.  If you're playing against Leela, Reina, or Gabe, then assume they are using Sneakdoor.  An Eli on archives is mandatory, and keeping backup ice in hand to throw on Archives if needs-be is necessary.  Maxx can be tough, but against Reg-ass Max (aka Minimum Punk Rock) hope to draw your Snatch and Grab to take out Kati, and against Siphon/Eater Maxx, Crisium is the most important card.  You have two Crisiums, and two centrals that can be hammered, for a reason.  Calimsha Kate (aka cheap-breaker, Prepaid Kate) is tough as she's geared to get in whenever necessary.  Your NEXT Golds are somewhat useless due to Sharpshooter recursion, but they are a means to tax the clone chips, which is better than having them taxed for Parasites.  Either way, get used to your NEXT Silvers dying to Parasites.  You have recursion for a reason.  In this match-up, you'll need a veritable tower on HQ.  Opus Valencia is beyond painful.  Especially if it is the version that love Wyldside + Adjusted Chronotype.  You'll need to take a gamble as to when is the best time to lock.

The meta is in an interesting space with everyone playing and optimizing for RP.  This hurts you because cards that are good against glacier are good against you.  Stimhack, big breakers, huge stealth rigs, etc...  So do the math.  Figure out how many layers of ice you need on HQ with the multiplicative effects of Crisium, Caprice, and Excalibur.  I like this deck, because as long as you know or can guess your opponent's deck, it comes down to math, and optimizing for what is required.  However, any tech for RP/NEH that focuses on remotes (e.g. Hacktivist Meeting) impact you significantly less.

## Possible Modifications

The slots that are somewhat malleable are:

- Excalibur - Really this is in there for entertainment factor.  I can't say it has won any games.  But it feels too good to rez to cut.
- Snatch and Grab - I'd highly advise against removing it, and would prefer it being x2 for consistency.  This is a meta call, but right now it is strong in the meta.
- 1x Ash - With all of the Anarch R&D deep dig out there 2x is needed for consistency.  Otherwise, R&D is good at defending itself after a Jackson or two.
- -1 Ash, +1 Corporate Troubleshooter (CT) - An earlier version of this deck used CT.  NEXT Gold + CT is great.  However, it is inconsistent, and easily handled by Faerie and Sharpshooter.
- -1 CW, +1 NAPD - increased resiliency for a decrease in consistency for getting what is usually the first agenda you want to score.
- -1-3x CW, +1-3 Mandatory Upgrades (MU) - I don't doubt that MU could be scored.  I doubt that it is worth the pain when you will likely win in a few turns anyway.

Slots that I'm sure people will modify, but I would recommend against:

- Subliminal Messaging - A good econ card in this deck.  It is more consistent than any of the other operation economy alternatives (Successful Demonstration or Peak Efficiency), and fills the hole of consistent drip econ.
- -NEXT Ice, +Anything else - Nope.  No ice scales like NEXT.  Bioroids are more expensive, and porous to high-impact early runs that lose you games.  Yes, NEXT is vulnerable to Parasite.  That's half the reason we have so much Archives recursion, and Jacksons.  Their destruction taxes your recursion.  Your ice recursion stresses their Parasite recursion.  And you have both more draw, and more money that they likely do.

## Final Thoughts

I know.  I could have just said "Hey all!  CI works well with OtG!" and saved you reading thousands of words.  I think that the process for coming up with new prototypes, and the reasoning behind it, are important.  This deck attempts to make a situation that the runner has difficulty recovering from, an inevitable lock.  Most importantly, it shows that with a little bit of analysis, even CI can be made to exist in a meta that kills its historical scoring mechanisms.  Please post on the forums; I'd appreciate your feedback!
