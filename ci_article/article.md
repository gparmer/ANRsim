# RIP Cerebral Imaging; Long Live Cerebral Imaging!

I have a confession to make:  I am a serial Cerebral Imaging (CI) player.  It is clear that we aren't seeing much CI being played currently, and haven't for a while.  I'll go over why I believe this is, and what can be done to make CI somewhat viable again.

Cerebral Imaging has a storied history as a kill-deck, or a combo-deck.  These prototypes are natural from the two main features of most CI decks:

1. Massive hand sizes often facilitated by a huge of amount of R&D digging.
2. Massive credit pools required by the massive hand sizes.

Since there is little pressure on the corp to put agendas out of their hand into remotes, most builds go remote-less.  Though some builds that focus on speed (7 points in one turn combos) put less of an emphasis on these (often staying around 13 cards and credits), many builds explode through operations up to 30+ credits.

I don't think that this article will make CI a tier 1 deck, but I do think it represents an interesting study in card interactions, and that the build is better than any of the popular CI decks.  This is a two part article that attempts to solve the problem of how CI can co-exist in the current meta.  This first part outlines the difficulties that CI is having with the current card pool, while the second part will introduce the deck that I believe compensates for the current meta.

## A Brief History of CI Builds

[PeekaySK](http://stimhack.com/cerebral-imaging-the-evolution-of-an-identity/) has done a great overview of the evolution of the CI prototypes over time, and I'm only going to review what he says briefly.  He does a much more thorough job than I, so please read that article.  He describes the CI builds clustering around:

> Taxing ICE, reasonably low agenda density in RnD (which only decreases as agendas are drawn and held in HQ), Operations-powered economy, Fast-Advance as a primary scoring mechanism (either eschewing remotes completely, or only using temporary ones), a fair amount of recursion for the key pieces. Gigantic hand size is used both to decrease the likelihood of agendas being stolen out of HQ, and to hold multi-card combos.

Briefly, a few of the CI builds he discusses:

- *Tag-n-bag.* Splashing Scorched Earths, and SEA Source, combined with a strong operation economy threatens runner death-by-nuke from a very early point in the game onward.  To play against this, the runner must often slow down and econ up (or dig for Plascretes).  This enables CI to do the same, which is where it wants to be:  avoiding early game runner aggro.

- *Accelerated Diagnostics + Power Shutdown combos.*  When you see this deck win once, you're impressed.  Then you never want to see it again.  It feels somewhat degenerate and "game breaking" that 7 points can be scored in a single turn, and I've seen the combo go off as early as turn 3 (thanks Dan for streaming).

- *Fast-advance variants.* Many of these feature Efficiency Committee scored with a double Biotic Labor, that is subsequently used with Shipment from San San to score a 5/3.   The game is finished with a third biotic on a 3/2.   This deck has to have a significant bank to pull off the 12 credit initial biotic+biotic+4 advance Efficiency Committee score.

Enough with review.  Why has this deck seen a slow death over the past half year?

## The Death of CI

What has killed each of these prototypes?

- *RIP tag-and-bag.*  A combination of the rise of Blue Sun that has forced people to tech for rich corporations that want to burn your house down.  Runners are running fairly rich, so Sea Sourcing a prepared runner is no longer a trivial matter.  Additionally, Anarchs got their answer to nuclear death in I've Had Worse.  The first scorch typically has at least a 4/5 chance of drawing the three additional cards required to survive the second scorch.  Not good odds to base your entire game-plan on.

- *RIP combo-wombo.*  Three cards straight-up kill this prototype:  Utopia Shard, Leela Patel, and Clot, all of which see some competitive play.  Leela Patel doesn't make it impossible for the combo to go off, just significantly more unlikely.  Utopia Shard and Clot (fetched during the combo) straight up kill it.

- *RIP fast-advance.* The masses are fleeing from Near-Earth Hub (NEH) to Replicating Perfection because of Clot.  Though it seems a minority of players are using Clot, when you face off against one of them with a fast-advance CI deck, your main game-plan is gone.  While Clot is in the meta, this prototype is not going be doing very well.

A few other factors have made CI's life quite a bit more difficult.  These include:

- *Turbo-mill.*  The general focus on increased R&D disruption through the increased prevalence of Noise has made digging aggressively into your deck a risky proposition.  This emphasizes your need for recursion facilities.

- *Ice destruction.* The increased capability to peel your ice off of your centrals both with the Cutlery, and with the renewed interest in Parasite and Clone Chip (often in Noise, Reina Roja, and Maxx) put pressure on your ability to raise the funds to maintain a large hand size *and* do what you need to to progress your game-plan.  Most CI decks run relatively ICE-light to make room for you operation econ, and this pressures you to increase the ICE count...but will you have the money to rez it?

- *Om-nom-nom.*  Eater decks can be quite painful.  They often feature both significant ice destruction (see above), *and* can get in with powerful events without gear checks.  Account Siphons and Vamps are the bane of CI, and these decks can get in with them.

- *R&D deep-dig.*  Noise and Valencia decks focused on Hive Mind, Incubator, and multiple Mediums are an issue.  The runner need only get into R&D once to see upwards of 20 cards.  CI is typically a late-game deck, so these decks must be dealt with.

Really, when imagining the current state of CI, it is useful to think of a punching bag, dented deep by the malice of the meta and the capriciousness of the current card pool.

But like I said before:  I'm a serial CI player.  And I don't mind being a punching bag.

## NEXT Generation CI

Deck building can be hard.  Especially when your buildling material is a punching bag.  I'm going to take a specific approach to try to innovate CI.  I won't go into the details of the methodology here (I'll write about it in the future), but it involves analysing the fundamental implications stemming directly from the identity, identifying prototypes that follow from those implications, and constructing a deck from cards that strengthen the prototype, and cards that store up its weaknesses.  There's nothing new here, but the approach is very methodological, which seems to force innovation.

*What does the ID tell us?* At the risk of repeating myself, it tells us that we want lots of cards in HQ, and to do so, require lots of credits.  If we don't keep lots of cards in hand, then why aren't we playing Engineering the Future (ETF)?  Ahh the HB curse.  The prototypes above focus around both combos due to the large hand size, and using lots of credits to score out of hand.  Lets define a new prototype for CI, and try and make it work: a CI -- *gasp* -- **with remotes**!

Why are CI decks with remotes quite rare?  Lets push first into this prototype's weaknesses:

- *RIP fast-advance.* Clot makes running a traditional CI deck too risky due to the auto-lose potential.  *Conclusion:* We must find a way to move our game to remotes.

- *Ice requirements.*  To have enough money and draw in the deck, many card slots are required for operation economy.  This typically crowds out the slots for Ice.  With fewer slots for ice, defending remotes becomes difficult.  Fewer ice slots makes the balance between early-game ice to stop game-ending Account Siphons, and late-game taxing ice all the more difficult. This balance is essential against most runners, and necessary, but not sufficient, to survive Eater decks.  *Conclusion:* We need a small ice suite that is both quick to keep aggressive plays out, yet taxing enough in the late-game to avoid bleeding agendas from HQ and, to a lesser extent, R&D.  If we have fewer ice, we also need a way to handle ice-destruction decks.

- *Bleeding from HQ.*  The typical way to beat CI is to get early agendas from R&D, and late-game use Legworks to snatch them from HQ.  If we are putting resources into defending a remote, this problem will only get worse.  This makes sense as the agenda density in HQ often approaches 1/3 late game as signficant portions of the deck's ice and operation are played.  *Conclusion:* We need to lessen the impact of the rare late-game, high-impact runs.

- *Turbo-milling + turbo-drawing.* Running out of cards in R&D is a real risk in CI decks.  Many include 3 Blue Level Clearances, 3 Green Level Clearances, and draw a few times a turn.  Noise loves to see this.  Without the draw, it can be difficult to have the required economy.  *Conclusion:*  We need to either avoid drawing as much as CI wants to do which contradicts the fundamental implications that follow from the identity, or mitigate the damage from mills, and win fast enough to not lose by milling.

- *Adversity to asset-based economy.*  Asset-based economy has a fundamental issue:  it is difficult to rez the asset economy early game, while maintaining enough credits to both defend centrals and keep a credit pool commensurate with your hand-size.  Early game is weakened in an id where early game is already dicey.  I've used decks that use a full complement of operation econ additionally including asset-based econ.  This leads to you being rich, or the runner being poor (from trashing many Eve Campaigns and Pad Campaigns), but removes slots in your deck for reliably scoring out. *Conclusion:* We don't need any more pressure on the already-pressured deck slots, and retreating to assets seems counter-productive.  I've tried to shore up this weakness, and failed many times.

What *still* works in CI?  Combos haven't gone away, and the ability to relatively quickly raise huge amounts of money from operations survives.

## Next Time

How can our CI hero exist in the current meta?  How can it learn to remote like a champ?  Stay tuned for our next Part 2 of this series that introduces the deck.
